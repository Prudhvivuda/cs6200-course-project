        Or Burned in the Fire Which
        Follows the Explosion.
        Property Loss Half a Million Dollars
        Gen. Harrison 'Gray Otis Principal Owner of Paper, Was in El Paso Friday The
        Oauseof the Explosion Not Definitely Determined, But -Management
        of the Paper Attributes It to the Troubles It Has Had With
        Labor Organizations Building and Plant Reported
        Completely "recked.
        Los Angeles, Calif., Oct. 1. The
        building and plant of the Lod Angeles
        Times, one of the best knewn news
        papers in the southwest, of which "Gen.
        Harrison Gray Otis is editor, and princi
        pal owner, was completely destroyed
        by an explosion and tire shortly after
        1 o'clock this morning, resulting in the
        death of upward of 20 of its employes
        and the financial loss of nearly
        500.000.
        The management lays the blame for
        the explosion to labor unions, with
        which the paper has long been en
        gaged in bitter warfare.
        It is charged that unidentified par-,
        ties set off the charge of dynamite in
        a blind alley which ran into the center
        of the building, wrecking the interior
        and setting it afire from roof to base
        ment. J
        The force of the explosion was ter-
        rific. It was heard for miles, and all
        windows in the vicinity of the Times"
        building, on First street and Broad
        way, were shattered. Between 50 and
        70" employes were in the structure at
        the time, 'and juntil the list can be'
        checked, it will be impossible to giv.e
        jjo. accurate list of casualties.
        TSeads of Paper Have Narrow Escapes.
        The heaas of the paper, including
        assistant general manager Harry
        Chandler, had narrow escapes from
        death. The building was equipped with
        gas fittings and the force of the ex
        plosion, tearing these pipes to pieces,
        released gas, which ignited in every
        part of the building.
        No other cause but that of a dyna
        mite explosion is advanced by wit
        nesses, except in the case of the West
        em Union telegraph operator, "William
        Firman, who stated that he detected
        an odor of gas throughout the building
        early in the night and called atten
        tion to it.
        A few minutes after the explosion
        the police arrested a man named Harry
        Pluke, who was making his way
        through the Broadway tunnel. Another
        man named William Irwin was arrest
        ed later, but the police are without
        clews.
        Wesley Reeves, secretary to manager
        Chandler, is among the missing, and it
        is believed he lost his life.
        Chandler Makes Statement.
        "You can say for me," said Mr.
        Chandler, "there is no doubt that this
        terrible outrage can be laid at the
        door of the labor unions. They have
        destrojed the building and killed a
        number of our men, but they can't kill
        the Times. There is no doubt but that
        the explosion was caused by a charge
        of dynamue placed apparently in a
        little blind alley in the center of the
        building. It is true the building was
        equipped with gas, but no gas explos
        ion could have caused it. For vear3 5
        we have been receiving threatening
        letters from people who said the paper
        ought to be blown up."
        The Times was issued today from the
        Herald plant and from an auxiliary
        plant of the Times in another part of
        the city. Manager Chandler said that
        two years ago the Times had establish
        ed aft auxiliary plant, equipping it
        with a press and 12 linotype machines
        with the expectation of the present
        plant some day being destroyed.
        Many Are Misnlnir.
        The' dead and missing come princi
        pally from the composing room, which
        was directly above the spot where the
        explosion took place. A number of
        printers and linotypers are missing
        and believed to be buried in the still
        burning debris in the basement of the
        building.
        .In the local room, all the editors and
        reporters had gone home, except two
        or three men. Assistant city editor
        Harvey Elder was still on duty when
        the explosion came. When the flames
        shot up through all parts Aof the build
        ing, Elder -was badly stunned, but at
        tempted to escape. He ran to the win
        dows opening on Broadway, but there
        was no fire escape thep, and he was
        hemmed in by the flames. He jumped.
        P'iremen below held a net, but he
        missed it and struck the pavement,
        dying soon afterwards.
        Night editor Taggart was at work
        in the composing room. He leaped
        through a window and made his way
        across the roofs of adjoining buildings
        safely. The entire force of telegraph
        editors and operators -was at work, ex
        cept telegraph editor R. N. Whitney.
        Harry C. Crane; assistant editor, was
        seen attempting to make his way out
        of the building, but has not been found
        among the survivors. Several men
        wore seen to come to upper windows a
        few moments after the fire brake out,
        and were heard to cry for help. Nets
        were stretched and many jumped to

        One Hundred and Fifteen in Building.
        Foreman Grayblll, of the composing
        room, estimated toda3' that there -were
        115 men In the building. He believes
        12 of his men -were killed and the fa
        talities in other departments about the
        same number. About 15 men were in
        the stereotyping department, but. he
        thinks all of these escaped. Eight
        women in the proofreading room, on
        the third floor, also escaped.
        Says It Was Second Attempt.
        Assistant manager chandler is au
        thority for the statement that an at
        tempt to blolv up the Times plant was
        made before' the explosion which de
        stroyed the main office. He said one
        of his men reported shortly before 1
        o'clock this morning that two men
        were seen by a special officer placing
        a ladder at the rear of the branch
        building and were climbing onto the
        roof. The officer says that, he fired at
        them twice and the men fled. Chief
        of Police Galloway said it seemed cer
        tain that the Times building was
        wrecked by dynamite.
        Call Off Labor Parade.
        Mayor Alexander, the city council,
        the city attorney, the chief of riollce
        and other municipal officials met with
        the officials of various local unions
        today and mutually agreed, to call oft
        the union labor parade which was to
        have been held Monday. The parade
        was arranged as a protest against the
        anti-pleketing ordinance. It was
        agreed that the parade during the
        present excitement would be unwise.
        Persons who were first on the scene
        state that there were three distinct ex
        plosions. The first seemed to be tho
        heaviest and occurred under the second
        floor, which is used as a composing
        room.
        The Wrecked Building.
        The building occupied by he Times
        was located on the southeast corner of
        Broadway and First street, fronting
        about 30 feet on First street and ex
        tending 75 or 100 feet along Broadway.
        The main building was- of rick, nrev
        stories in v height and back( of this
        jvas a brick annex, two stories and
        basement. The editorial department
        was on the third floor of the main build
        ing. The business offices were on the
        ground flo"br. The annex contained
        presses, linotypes, big job printing
        In the Mornin
        Work Ire ,the
        Death Or
        Which
        plant and the Times school for training
        linotype operators. The Times em
        ployed non-union printers and main
        tained a large battery of linotypes for
        teaching and training operators in the
        use of those machines.
        Long Opposed Unions.
        For 20 years the Times has been at
        war with labor unions, starting with a
        strike of the members of the typograph
        ical union employed on the paper. Gen.
        Otis is on his way back from Mexico
        City and Is expected here today. Po
        lice had fire lines stretched around the
        scene soon after the fire broke out and
        reserves were patroling the district
        armed with riot clubs, but the half clad
        crowd which silently watched the
        flames from behind the fire lines- was
        orderly" 'anSPuotf 'an arrest was made
        from the crowd.
        PRESIDENT LYNCH RESENTS
        f CHARGE AGAINST UNIQNS
        Indianapolis, Ind., Oct. 1. "The Los
        Angeles Times for many years has been
        a bitter, unrelenting and unreasoning
        enemy of trades unionism, and it is
        characteristic of the Times manage
        ment that, without waiting to investi
        gate it should charge the disaster to
        the trades unions," said president
        James M. Lynch, of the International
        Typographical union, today.
        "The typographical union resents
        and refutes this charge," said Mr.
        Lynch. "We have always fought fair.
        The International Typographical union
        Is not a law breaking, dynamiting In
        stitution. Its record of more than 60
        years' existence Is an honorable one.
        No one regrets the Times catastrophe
        more than I do. On the other hand, we
        are determined to protect ourselves
        against the opportunity embraced by
        Gen. Otis and his subordinates to at
        tempt to fasten the explosion on the
        trades unions."
        President! Lynch said he had wired
        his Los Angeles representative to take
        necessary measures to protect fthe In
        ternational Typographical union and
        the local union from the charge of com
        plicity, "as the press reports convince
        us the explosion was caused by faulty
        gas mains and was due entirely to the
        unsanitary condition of the Times
        plant."
        GOMPERS SAYS HE DOESN'T
        THINK UNION MEN DID IT
        St. Louis, Mo., "Oct. 1. Samuel Gom
        pers, president of the American Federa
        tion of Labor said today he did not be
        lieve union labor members were in any
        way responsible for the explosrti and
        fire which destroyed the building of the
        Los Angeles Times.
        "The position of tne Times toward
        union labor wag well known," said Mr.
        Gompers, "but nothing has happened
        recently to make the feeling of the
        unlon men against the paper more acute.
        I regret the loss of lives, and destruc
        tion of property, but see no reason for
        thinking that union members had any
        thing to do with it"

        GEN. OTIS, OWNER OF THE
        TIMES, IN EL PASO FRIDAY
        Gen. Harrison Gray Otis, managing
        editor of the Los Angeles Times, was
        in El Paso Friday on his way home
        from Mexico City, where he attended
        the centennial celebration as a delegate
        from California. Gen. Otis left on tne

        Saturday afternoon at
        4 oclock.
        Two El Paso men, it Is said, were on
        the Los Angeles Times at the time of
        the explosion. Al D. Greene, formerly

      <text>DYNAMITE LOS ANGELES "TIMES"
        Many Employes Killed and Los Angeles Times Build
        ing a Total Loss With Property Damage to Amount
        of Half a Million—Loss is Accredited to Labor Unions
        With Which it Had Waged an Unceasing Warfare.
        Los Angeles, CaL, Oct. I.—The building and plain of
        the Los Angeles Times, one of the best known newspa
        pers of the southwest, of which General Harrison Gray
        Otis is editor and principal owner, was eompeltely de
        stroyed by an explosion and tire shortly after 1 oYlock
        this morning, resulting in the death of upwards of twen
        ty employes and a financial loss of nearly half a million
        dollars. The management of the paper lays the blame
        of the explosion on the labor unions, with which organ
        izations the paper lias long been engaged in a bitter
        warfare.
        It is charged that unknown par-1
        ties set off a heavy charge of dvna-1
        mite in a blind alley which ran into j
        the center of the building, complete
        ly wrecking the interior and setting
        it on fire from roof to basement. The
        force of the explosion was terrific
        and was heard for miles. All the
        windows in the vicinity of the Times
        building at First and Broadway were
        shattered. Between 50 and 75 em-!
        ployes were Mi the building at the
        time of the explosion, and until the
        i
        whole list of employes of the paper
        can be checked over it will not be i
        known how many lives were lost.
        The responsible heads of the pa- 1
        per, including Assistant General
        Manager Harry Chandler, had nar
        row escapes from death, many of
        them having left the building a
        short time before the explosion.
        The fire spread throughout the I
        building with amazing rapidity, and
        in the course of but a few seconds j
        the flames were bursting from every j
        window and door in the building,
        shooting high above the roof.
        Xo Clue to Perpetrators.
        The building was equipped with
        gasfittings and the force of the ex
        plosion tearing *these pipes into bits
        released the gas, which was instant
        ly ignited in every part of the build
        ing.
        There is no other cause than dy
        namite, is the evidence of witnesses,
        except in the one case of the West
        ern Union telegraph operator, Wm.
        Firmin, who stated that he detected
        the odor of gas throughout the
        building early in the night and had
        called the attention of others to it.
        A few minutes after the explosion
        the police arrested a man named
        Harry Lake, who was making his
        way through the Broadway tunnel a
        few blocks distant. He was locked
        up on suspicion. Another man
        named William Irwin was arrested
        and afterward taken to the station.
        The police are without clues, how
        ever.
        Assistant General Manager Chand
        ler narrowly escaped with his life.
        His office was on the ground floor
        and he left a few minutes before the
        explosion. He is accustomed to re
        main in his office until late in the
        morning but last night his wife came
        for him and he went home earlier
        than usual. His secretary, I. T.
        Westley Reaves, remained in the of
        fice and is among the missing.
        Says Ijabor Unions Responsible.
        Speaking of the explosion. Mr.
        Chandler said: "You can say for
        me that there is no doubt that this
        terrible outrage can be laid to the
        doors of the labor unions. They have
        destroyed the building and plant and
        have killed a number of our men.
        We do not know how many, but they
        cannot kill the Times. There is no
        doubt but that the explosion was
        caused by a charge of dynamite. No
        other agency could have caused it.
        There was no oil in the building, we
        had no boilers to explode, there was
        no gasoline in the place excepting a
        small can or two in the composing
        room. It is true the building was
        equipped with gas, but no explosion
        of gas could have caused it. It was
        evidently aimed to destroy the plant,
        and kill as many as possible of the
        employes. For years we have been
        receiving threatening letters from
        people who said that the paper ought
        to be blown up. 1 have not received
        any such letters lately, although I
        have had several telephone calls
        within the past few weeks, threaten
        ing us with destruction.''
        Had Auxiliary Plant.
        Two years ago. in anticipation of
        just such a thing as has occurred
        this morning, the Times established
        an auxiliary plant, equipped with
        linotypes and presses. The Times
        was issued today from the plant of
        the Morning Herald and the Times
        auxiliary plant.
        General Otis was absent from the
        city when the newspaper was de
        stroyed this morning. He is on his
        Established July 4,190f
        5c PER COPY
        I way back to Los Angeles from The
        !City of Mexico, where he went some
        weeks ago as a representative of the
        United States government by ap
        pointment from President Taft to the
        celebration of the Mexican centen
        nial. General Otis is due to arrive
        in Los Angeles late this afternoon.
        The building in which the Times
        was housed was stone and brick. The
        part four stories high is of stone,
        built in ISS7. The six stories of
        brick were added later.
        Many From Composing Hoom Ieatl.
        The dead and missing come prin
        cipally from the composing room,
        which was directly above where the
        explosion occurred. A number of
        primers and linotype operators are
        missing and it is believed are buried
        in the still burning ruins and debris.
        All but three or four of the editorial
        staff had gone home but the entire
        force of telegraph editors and tele
        graph operators was at work, with
        the exception of one man, who had
        just left the building. Those in thp
        building made their way to the win
        dows wherever possible, and some
        jumped to the roofs of the adjoining
        buildings. Many jumped to the
        street, but some who had climbed
        into the windows were seen to fall
        back into the flames. Owing to the
        wrecked condition of the building
        many are believed to have been un
        able to reach the windows or other
        exits.
        Called Off Labor Parade.
        Mayor Alexander, the city council, j
        chief of police and other municipal
        officials met today with representa
        tives of tbe labor unions. It was re
        solved to call off the proposed union
        labor parade Monday in protest
        against the anti-picketing ordinance
        and other alleged anti-union labor
        'conditions exisiting in the city. It
        j was agreed that such assemblage in
        tbe midst of the present excitement
        was unwise.
        The city council voted a $25,000
        •fund to be used to run down the
        i perpetrators of the alleged dynamit
        ing of the Los Angeles Times. The
        j $25,000 was made available as a re
        j ward for the capture of the culprit
        jor culprits.
        Pressmen Kscaped.
        The men in the pressroom, which
        j was in the basement, all escaped. It
        'is estimated that 125 men were in the
        building at the time of the explosion.
        Two Watchmen Kmployed.
        The Times employed two night
        i watchmen but they saw no one about
        the building to arouse their sus
        picions. One of the watchmen was
        jv, B. Glasier. He was not found
        land it is believed he perished.
        Tried to Blow Up Auxiliary Plant.
        Manager Chandler is authority for
        the statement that a similar attempt
        was made to blow up the Times' aux
        iliary plant last night. One of the
        employes saw two men trying to
        climb to the roof. He fired two shots
        at them. The men fled. He inter
        prets this second attemps as further
        proof of a carefully planned effort
        made last night to destroy both the
        Times main and branch office.
        Would Blow Up Zeehandelaar.
        Additional excitement was dis
        covered in an infernal machine un
        der the residence of Secretary F. J.
        Zeehandelaar of the Merchants and
        Manufacturers' association, who has
        been active in conjunction with the
        Los Angeles Times in opposition to
        labor unions. The machine was dis
        covered by Special Officer Hendrick
        son. who. under instructions from
        the chief of police, placed the ma-
        chine, which was of clockwork pat
        tern, in an isolated place. No arrGats
        have been made. The deadly char
        acter of the bomb was established
        by the police and detectives. It con
        sisted of 15 sticks of dynamite at
        tached to a fuse with clockwork at-
        tachment.
        An attempt was made this after
        noon to dynamite the home of Gen
        eral Otis, but nod-image was done.

        REVIEWED BY GENE DEBS
        In Caustic Sentences Labor Leader Shows Utter Fal
        lacy of Charge Made by Otis—The Animus Behind
        the Attack Upon Organized Labor Fully Exposed
        Tho blowing up of the Los Angeles
        Times and the snuffing out of twentj
        human lives is another of the atrocious
        crimes committed in the heat mid pas
        sion of the class war. Who committed
        that crime 1 Harrison Cray Otis, pro
        prielor of the 'l imes, and the capitalist
        PKBB of the Pacific Coast in general,
        charge it directly and specifically up
        explosion whs followed by the charge
        thai union labor was guilty of the crime
        as swiftly as the capitalist press could
        telegraph the indictment to the coun
        try.
        It appears well settled in Mr. Otis'
        statement and the 'limes account that
        the Times building was blown up by
        dynamite, and equally well settled that
        the crime was committed by labor
        unionists. As one who knows the Los
        Angeles Times by personal experience
        with that vicious, lying and criminal
        sheet I want to express it as my de
        liberate opinion that the Times and its
        crowd of union haters are themselves
        the instigators, if not the actual per
        petrators of that crime and the mur
        ders of the twenty human beings who
        perished ns its victims.
        First of all, let me relate my own
        experience with General Harrison Otis
        nnd the Los Angeles Times. At the
        time of the railroad strike in 1894, the
        Los Angeles Times lied about me out
        rageously, charged me with every con
        ceivable crime, editorially stated that 1
        deserved the gallows and did all in its
        power to send me there. Shortly nfter
        the strike I went to Los Angeles to
        give a public address. The following
        morning the Times had a column of
        editorial abuse and vilification the like
        of which has randy appeared in public
        print, but not a word of my address.
        I was charged with arson, conspiracy,
        treason. murder, and assassination.
        There were in this villlanous article
        thirteen deliberate, clear-cut. mnde-to
        order, montsrous lies. 1 nt once con
        cluded to return to Los Angeles nfter
        filling my immediate engagements nnd
        make answer to this outrageous indict
        ment; and here let me ssy that any
        man who would make such false and
        fiendish charges against another to glut
        his insane hatred of organized labor
        would commit any other crime to serve
        the same base end.
        A few days later I returned to Los
        Angeles to find the old Hazard's pa
        vilion packed to the doors, every inch
        of stnnding room occupied nnd thou
        sands turned away, to hear my answer
        to Otis and the Times. It so happened
        that I had in my grip the documentary
        evidence, including government reports,
        to prove my innocence of the most
        vicious of these charges. In one hand
        I held up the Los Angeles -Times and
        in the other the positive proof of its
        criminal mendacity. I went through
        the thirteen charges seriatim and liter
        ally tore them to tatters. I had not
        proceeded far »nt>\ some one in the
        audience shouted, "Otis is In the house,"
        and this proved to be true. I at on'-e
        challenged General Otis to come for
        ward nnd face me, whom he had so out
        rage lonely maligned, before his own
        people. It is needless to sny that, al
        though the crowd yelled "Otis, Otis,
        Otis," he did not dare to come and he
        would gladly have disappeared if the
        packed nnd Jammed condition of tha
        hall had not barred his escape.
        But from that day to this, although
        their monstrous lies have long since
        found them out, General Otis and his
        keproUS sheet have never uttered one
        word of retraction, and it is not their
        fault that I was not lynched or hanged
        for crimes of which 1 was as innocent
        ns are the union men of Los Angeles
        upon Whom General Otis is now seeking
        to fasten his atroeioias calumnies as
        he did upon me and my fellow-union
        ists fifteen yenrs ago.
        Now let us examine some of the facts
        in regard to the blowing up of the
        Times and some of the circumstantial
        evidence, nnd let us see if it is not im
        possible to escape at least the inference,
        if not the positive conclusion, that Otis
        and his gang are themselves the con
        spirators and criminals.
        The theory that he who is benefited
        by a crime is most apt to have a hand
        in its commission is peculiarly appli
        cable to this case. Financially and
        morally Otis and the Times have every
        thing to gain as certainly as organized
        labor ban everything to lose in bearing
        the crushing odium of the crime. 1/ot
        it Ik- remembered that General Otis was
        perfectly certain that the outrage, si
        most before it was committed, was the
        dnstardly act of union laW. He per
        sonnlly was at a safe distance, and all
        th* vie tims were wage slaves, and what
        do Otis and his crowd of exploiting
        plutocrats care sbottt the lives of
        slaves* Vow for a few of these facts:
        First, The class war on the Pacific
        Coast had reached it* acntest stage and
        EVERETT. WASHINGTON. FRIDAY. OCTOBER 21, 1910.
        was rapidly approaching a grave crisis
        at the time of the explosion. It was in
        striking analogy to the blowing up of
        the Independence platform in the class
        war in Colorado five years ago, nnd we
        now know beyond the shadow of a
        doubt what side committed thai re
        volting crime and what was its ob
        ject.
        Second. The tide of organised labor
        in California was steadily rising, the
        Socialist campaign was in full swing,
        and there was to be a culminating
        'demonstration of the united labor forces
        [at Los Angeles but a few days after
        t'ho Times was blown up. This dem
        onstration was promptly called off by
        'the leaders of the unions, a grievous
        blunder on their pnrt, which places
        them in a defensive nnd apologetic at
        titude utterly unwarranted by the cir
        cumstances of the situation. Instend
        of pleading not guilty to the criminal
        charge preferred against the workers,
        without a scintilla of proof they should
        have immediately accused Otis nnd his
        gang of union-haters nnd called upon
        them to prove that their own hands
        were not red with the crime.
        Third, Tho l\os Angeles Times is the
        most venomous foe of organized labor
        in the United States nnd its own record
        prove* that there is no crime too nl>
        horrent for it to commit to wreck its
        vengeance on the labor movement.
        Fourth, The statement is made by the
        Times itself and confirmed by press
        dispatches from Chicago that General
        Otis, "having antlcipatd just such an
        eventuality." hnd a duplicate printing
        plant and n duplicate working force in
        reserve, all in readiness to leap into the
        breach nnd rescue the paper when the
        expected bomb exploded. This admis
        sion proves too much. It is fatal to
        Otis and file Times. What cause had
        Otis to anticipate the explosion nn.l
        prepare for it? Suppose a labor union
        ist had made such an admission, or
        even intimated that he knew the ex
        plosition would occur, would he not
        promptly be arrested on suspicion nnd
        lodged in jail?
        Yes. we are only too ready to be
        lieve that Otis and his pals expected
        the explosion and were entirely pre
        pared for it when it came.
        Fifth, The united league of newspa
        pers which embraces a chain of daily
        papers scattered over the country, and
        friendly in their attitude towards or
        ganized labor, recently sent a special cor
        respondent to California to investigate
        conditions growing out of the war be
        tween lalior and capital on the Pacific
        Coast, nnd his series of articles is now
        running in those papers. These articles
        describe a situation and a desperation
        on the part of the capitalists that has
        a fitting climax in the blowing up of
        the Times, as the same war had in the
        blowing up of the Independence plat
        form in Colorado.
        In the second article of this series-—
        and let it be remembered that these are
        capitalist papers and not Inlaw papers
        the capitalists composing the manu
        facturers' association are described as
        in a state bordering on frenzy in their
        determination to utterly annihilate "at
        any cost and at all hazards" organized
        labor on the Pacific Const. The chnir
        innn is personally quoted as saying to
        the correspondent representing these
        capitalist newspapers: WK WILL
        NEVER CEASK UNTIL THE LAST
        VESTIGE OF UNION LABOR HAS
        BEEN WIPED OFF THE PACIFIC
        COAST."
        This vehement and bloodthirsty de
        claration was made only a short time
        before the Times was blown up nnd the
        united workers, a few days later, were
        to have their mnminoth demonstration.
        Sixth, The discovery of the I ib
        is the one fareinl feature of this grue
        some tragedy, which every human being
        not utterly void of feeling must de
        plore with all his heart. To prove that
        it was the fiendish plot of unionists,
        other bombs, accessories to the crime,
        and |Kinting to the identity of its per
        petrators, must Ik- located and un
        earthed. Of course it was known in
        stantaneously where to look for the
        bosahs, and of course they were sll
        found according to specifications. In
        each case they were located at the pal
        ntial homes of the proprietors and man
        SMS of the 'limes and the manufactur
        ers' association. BUT IN NO CASE DID
        ONE OF THESE BOMBS EXPLODE.
        The bomb that did explode blew up
        the wage slaves of the Times only; the
        bombs that did not explode did not
        blow up any of the aristocratic owners
        and managers. there is a peculiar
        bomb consciousness in evidence here
        flint clearly draws the line between
        capitalists and wuge workers.
        In Chicago following the Haymarket
        riot a regular crop of bombs was har
        vested in plutocratic reservations until
        finally the thing was overworked by

      <time>October 28, 1910: California State Federation of Labor releases a report concluding that the explosion was caused by a gas leak, not by dynamite.</time>
      <text>EXPLOSION CAUSED BY GAS SAYS
        LABOR FEDERATION COMMITTEE
        EFFECTS PRODUCED SHOW
        IT WAS NOT DYNAMITE THAT
        WRECKED TIMES BUILDING
        San Francisco, Oct. 28. That the
        Los Angeles Times was destroyed as
        a result of the explosion of gas", and
        not by dynamite, Is the finding of the
        committee of the executive council
        of the California State Federation of
        Labor, which for four weeks haa been
        working on the investigation of the
        catastrophe. The report has Just been
        submitted to the federation.
        The report is prefaced with a de
        tailed account of the committee's re
        ception by Mayor Alexander, of Los
        Angeles, when It called upon him and
        informed him that it desired to co
        operate with the citizens' committee
        appointed by the city council to in
        vestigate the disaster. The mayor
        refused to grant the request. The
        committee then determined on an in
        vestigation of its own. After, some
        parley the committee secured permis
        sion to pass the police lines and
        viewed the wreckage' from the prop
        erty adjoining the Times building.

        THE GREATER
        Smelled the Gas All Day Before
        At this time even the city employes
        had been ordered oft of the property
        by the Times owners, the report says.
        The report then recites the princi
        pal facts of the explosien, and the
        subsequent events, referring to the
        fact that the Time sitself, in the issue
        on the morning of the explosion, and
        before there was any time for inves
        tigation, it alleges, charged that the
        explosion was caused by the enemies
        of "Industrial freemdom." The re
        port refers to articles printed in sub
        sequent Issues of the Times charging
        union labor with responsibility for the
        catastrophe.
        "Inasmuch as there many persons
        who are not acquainted with Gener
        al Harrison Gray Otis and his news
        paper," the report continues, "and
        who, therefore, naturally would sup
        pose that there exists evidence to sup
        port such assertions, it would seem
        Important to shed some light on the
        matter?'
        The report then .reviewed General
        Otis' fight against unionism in Los
        Angeles, saying, among other things,
        that "on the subject of Industrial
        freedom it is no exaggeration to say
        that General Otis is Insane."
        The report further says the dream
        of the general's life haa been to ex
        terminate unionism la Los Angeles.
        "Trumptelng abroad the report
        that unionists were plotting to d6 htm
        violence, Otis made his editorial
        rooms an arsenal," the report says.
        It then refers to the bitter fight made
        by the Times against the unions dur
        ing the recent strike of the metal
        and brewery workers in Los Angeles,
        and continues:'
        "Such was the situation Just pre
        vious to the blowing up of the Times.
        It has not been determined that the

      <text>LABOR LEADERS
        BRAND DYNAMITE
        ARREST AS PLOT
        McNamara, National Secretary of Iron
        workers, Being Rushed to Los Angeles
        By Secret Route.
        DETECTIVE BURNS FAILS
        IN RAIDS FOR EVIDENCE
        Detectives operating under orders from William J. Burns, are today
        secretly spiriting to Los Angeles, John J. McNamara, of the International
        Structural Iron Workers, there to try him for dynamiting and murder.
        President Samuel Gompers and Secretary Frank Morrison, of the
        American Federation of Labor, in Washington, President James M. Lynch,
        of the Typographical Union, in Indianapolis, and many other great leaders
        of labor, today declare that this is an attack on organized labor of the
        country, not merely on McNamara.
        In Indianapolis, Detective Burns failed in one hunt for evidence to
        prove McNamara is the leader of dynamiters. Early this morning Burns
        had the safe at the union headquarters blown open, but did not find any
        thing to incriminate McNamara.
        From Los Angeles it Is reported that another labor leader, noted on
        the Pacific coast, will be under arrest before night, on the charge of
        being the Pacific manager of what the Burns men term the "dynamiting
        conspiracy."
        This afternoon the attorney for the Structural Iron Workers in In
        dianapolis made the charge that the private papers of the international
        association were seized by Detective Burns and turned over bodily to
        the Erectors' Association, the manufacturers' organization, which Is
        financing Detective Burns In this fight The papers have been ordered
        returned.
        In Chicago it Is understood that
        Manlgal, arrested as the ag
        of Secretary McNamara, are still being
        concealed there by officer' j who fear to
        start them on the journey for Los Angeles.
        Labor Leaders Brand
        Arrest of McNamara
        As "Infamous Outrage"
        Applying tho brand of "infamous out
        rage" to the arrest in indlanapolU last
        night of John J. McNamara, interna
        tional secretary of the Bridge and Struc
        tural Iron Workers of America, official.?
        of the American Federation of Labor
        today declared that the charge made
        against McNamara of complicity in the
        dynamiting of the Los Angeles Times
        office Is nothing more than another at
        tempt of capitalists to discredit organ
        ized labor In the eyes of the world.
        That dynamite was "planted" In the
        barn near Indianapolis and hidden in
        the storerooms of the Iron Workers'
        Union building by opponents of unions,
        anxious to make evidence against them.
        Is the belief of such officers as Presi
        dent Samuel Gompers and Secretary
        Frank Morrison of the American Fede
        ration of Labor. The same belief Is held
        by William J. Spencer, secretary of the
        building trades department of the
        American Federation of Labor and a
        personal friend of the accused official.
        "Legalized Kidnaping."
        Forceful words were used by the
        American Federation officials in their
        endeavor to express their contempt for
        tho Injustice they believe has been done
        Secretary McNamara in spiriting him
        away from Indianapolis without, grant
        ing him legal representation, or even
        communication with his friends.
        "How long are the American people
        going to stand for legalized kidnap
        ing?" With this query Samuel Gompers.
        president of the American Federation
        of Labor, today declares his belief in
        the innocence of union steel worker,
        arrested at Indianapolis for alleged
        complicity in dynamiting outrages.
        Angrily and Indignantly, President
        Gompers charges the arrest to en
        emies of organized labor, a plot to
        destroy labor unions by huge money
        Interests. He characterizes the sum
        mary removal of McNamara from In
        dianapolis to California as "high
        handed legal kidnaping."
        "McNamara's extradition is a gross
        ly outrageous piece of legalized kid
        naping," 6aid President Gompers this
        morning at his home, 2122 First street
        northwest.
        In Class With Haywood Case.
        "Nothing except the Haywood, Moy
        er, and Pettlbone case equals It in the
        besmirched history of attacks upon
        organized labor," said President Gom
        pers. "McNamara was spirited away with
        out giving him the slightest chance
        to gltfe prima facie, evidence of his
        Innocence taken from hi3 own home
        and State without aid of friends or
        attorneys," President Gompers con
        tinued with passion.
        Declaring the arrest of the union
        men "smacks of theatricals," Presi
        dent Gompers said.
        "The staga was all set, the properties
        arranged carefully and then up goe3
        the curtain, with a blare of trumpets,

        "Every since the Los Angeles Times
        tragedy the 'interests' have been trying
        to fasten guilt upon organized labor. It
        might just as welt be McNamara as
        another. The whole affair smacks of
        well laid pre-arrangement.

        "There Is more dynamite In Indianap

        Meanwhile Burns has McNamara -well
        on his way to Los Ajigeles, though no
        one has yet found lust how far. The
        only vestige of information obtained so
        far bv McNamara's friends has been
        that the journev to Chicago, whether
        completed yd or not. Is bv automobile,
        evidently so that the route cannot be
        foreseen and legal obstacles made.
        On one point the labor leaders arc
        Jubilant. All last night and up to the
        parly hours of this morning the officers
        of the International Structural Iron
        Workers fought the efforts of Detective
        Burns to open the safe of the organi
        zation, which was used by McNamara
        as secretary-treasurer. But in spite of
        their opposition Bums finally had thi
        safe blown open early this morning, only
        to find not the sllchtest bit of evidence
        against the accused. Bums himself ad
        mitted the failure, this morning.
        Pacific Coast Leader Sought
        From Los Angeles has come the well
        accredited report that a warrant has
        been issued for still another noted labor
        leader, this one a Pacific coast leader,
        charging htm with being the Pacific
        coast manager of what the Burns men
        call the dynamite conspiracy. This man
        Is expected to bo under arrest before
        night.
        It is known to the labor leaders here
        that the other two men who are under
        arrest In connection with the affair
        James W. McNamara, of Cincinnati,
        brother of Secretary McNamara. alias
        J. B. Bryce, and Ortle E. McManlgal. of
        Chicago already are on their long trip
        to Los Angeles, in the custody of Los
        Angeles police.
        In spite of the failure of Burns to find
        any evidence In the safe at headquar
        ters, and in spite of the failure of two
        of his men, Shlnn and Dugan. to find
        anything Incriminating In a search of
        McNamara's room, so far as can be
        learned, the whole Burns force Is Jubi
        lant today over the two discoveries of
        dynamite, one in the basement store
        room of the iron workers' building, and
        the other in the barn In the outskirts
        of the city, owned by T H. Jones.
        They point out that the evidence of
        Jones is the strongest of all yet brought
        out. He is an Iron worker himself, and
        told his story reluctantly. It Is to the
        effect that he rented his barn In Janu
        ary to McNamara for J23 a month and
        had frequently seen McNamara and
        others going and coming to the barn
        with heavy suit cases.
        Fight to Get At Safe.
        The blowing of the safe of the Inter
        national Structural Iron Workers early
        this morning was accomplished only
        after many difficulties. When the de
        tectives went to the union headauarters
        in the American Central Life Building
        last night. President Ryan, of tho Inter
        national Union, was ready for them,
        and was prepared to fight.
        Tho detectives presented a search
        warrant, and demanded access to the
        safe of the union. President Ryan
        refused, and the detectives then pre
        pared to go ahead. A lawyer for the
        ui.ion then Interfared. and his op
        position was so vigorous and appar
        ently sound that the Burns men final
        ly went back to Judge Collins and
        obtained another search warrant, spe
        cifically giving them the right to
        search the safe.

        "Third Degree" Charges Are Pressed.
        GOMPERS AND SPENCER LEAVE
        CITY ON SOME SECRET MISSION
        A double-barreled Investigation by Congress is the latest promised
        development in the arrest of John J. McNamara, James W. McNamara,
        and Ortie McManigal, the three men now being hurried to Los Angeles
        to face charges of dynamiting and murder.
        Representative Berger, the Socialist member of the House, today
        introduced his resolution demanding a Federal Investigation of the
        methods used in removing John J. McXamara from Indianapolis, and
        the securing of an alleged confession from Ortie McManigal by "third
        degree" methods.
        A representative of the Senate Third Degree Committee held a
        long conference with Samuel Gompers yesterday afternoon, and it Is
        likely that a meeting of this committee will be called in the near future.
        John E. Wilkie, chief of the United States Secret Service, and Stanley
        Finch, head of the Bureau of Investigation of the Department of Justice,
        today denied that their Secret Service men had at any time assisted
        Burns' detectives in the investigation of the dynamite outrages.
        President Gompers, of the Federation of Labor, and William J.
        Spencer, secretary of the building trades department of the Federation,
        left the city today on a secret mission.
        The McNamara brothers and Ortie McManigal passed through Den
        ver today on their way to Los Angeles.
        District Attorney Fredericks, of Los Angeles, announces that the
        arrested men will be prosecuted as individuals, and no attempt will be
        made to fasten the crime on organized labor.

        on charges of complicity In the wreck

        Tho demand Is based on the claim that
        there has been a violation of the Con

        steps detrimental to "life, liberty, and
        property" have been taken "without
        due process of law."
        Berger Resolution.
        The Berger resolution Is follows:
        "Whereas, tho fourteenth amend
        ment to the Constitution ordaln3
        that no State shall 'deprive any
        person of life, liberty, or property

        any person within its Jurisdiction
        the equal protection of the laws, and

        Namara, and to report its tlndlngs to
        the two houpes at the earliest prac

        In the Senate it Is expected that the

        mittee will probe the tactics utcd In se
        curing the alleged confession of Mc
        Manigal. Senator Brandegee's attention
        was called to the statement that Mc
        aianigal withstood a constant charge of
        questions for twelve hours before he
        broke down and told his story.
        A representative of the committee al
        ready has discussed with President
        Gompers the tactics used in securing
        the statement, and it is expected the of
        ficial probe of the circumstances will be
        started with the next meeting of the
        "I cannot say what steps will be
        taken said Senator Brandegee, the
        chairman of the commission, this morn

        closed." Leaders Gone.
        Considerable Interest Is beine taken
        today over the activity of the Ameri
        can Federation ot Labor, because
        President Gompers and Secretary Wil
        liam J. Spencer of the building trades'
        branch of the federation, have left
        Washington. At Mr. Gompers' offlce
        it was stated he had gone to New
        York to fill an engagement some time
        ago, but no one at Mr. Spencer's offlce
        was prepared to say whether he had
        accompanied Mr. Gompers.
        Secretary Frank Morrison said he
        did not know what had called Mr.
        Spencer from the city, but was sure
        Mr. Gompers' absence was not the
        result of the new labor troubles.
        That the American Federation of La
        bor stands ready to send out an appeal
        to all its affiliated bodies as soon as
        assistance Is asked for McNamara has
        been learned here. When the big strug
        gle for the organization of labor along
        the Pacific coast reached its climax
        some time ago an appeal was made and
        $600,000 raised. It is expected that the
        appeal now pending will bring an
        equally large amount.
        No Official Advices.
        According to Secretary Morrison, the
        Federation has received no official ad
        vice of all that has happened In Indian

        to make public any more of their plans

        Have McNamara Taken Back.
        (IJy United Press Leased Wire.)
        INDIANAPOLIS. April 26.
        Determined to fight to the last
        ditch for John J. McNamara, in
        ternational secretary of the Struc
        tural Ironworkers, accused of in
        spiring dynamite explosions in
        Los Angfles, labor leaders here to
        day launched a plan to undo the
        so-called "kidnaping" of McXa
        mara and force his return here
        from the California city.
        Acting on advice by Clarence
        Darrow, whose work acquitted
        Moyer, Hay wood and Pettibone of
        charges of inspiring the assassi
        nation of former Qov. Steunen
        berg of Idaho, telegrams were
        sent to Congressman Korbly and
        •Senators Shively and Kern of In
        diana asking them to introduce
        resolutions in congress to inves
        tigate the details of the manner
        In which McNamara was spirited
        out of Indianapolis and rushed
        to the west.
        Burns to Tell AH.
        As a part of this plan. Detec
        tive William J. Burns, who was
        arrested here last night, charged
        with having inspired McNamara's
        kidnaping, was taken before the
        grand jury today and is expected
        to reveal to these lnqulßltorg in
        full the developments which led
        to the removal of Mc.Vamara. It
        is probable that the grand jury
        will first hear all evidence from
        Burns regarding the alleged find
        ing of dynamite before consider
        ing the kidnaping proper.
        Legal experts here declare that
        Darrow's .plan to force the return
        of McNamara from Los Angeles
        is entirely feasible. The fact
        that it is not contended that Mc-
        Namara was in California at all
        at or immediately prevlouß to
        the explosion at the Los Angeles
        Times, which crime he is accused
        of plotting, will, they say, prove
        a big obstacle to the Burns'
        forces efforts to force the labor
        leader to trial in the California
        courts.
        Darrow's contention will be
        that, as McNatnara's rights have
        been invaded, it is only just that
        he should be restored to his posi
        tion before the law prior to that
        Invasion.

        LOS ANGELES MURDERS
        James B. McNamara, Man Who Blew Up The Times, Which
        Carried With It The Death of Twenty-one
        Employes.
        CONFESS IN HOPE OF ESCAPING DEATH PENALTY
        John J. McNamara, the One Who Destroyed Llewellyn Iron
        Works-One Escapes With Life Sentence, Other
        Probably With Fourteen Years
        LOS ANGELES, Dec I.—James B. McNamara pleaded guilty to murder
        ill tht; first, degree in .Judge Walter Bordwell's court today. His brother,
        John J. McNamara, secretary of the International Association of Bridge
        and Structural Iron Workers, entered a plea of guilty to dynamiting the
        Llewellyn Iron Works in Los Angeles, Christmas day, 1910.
        Clears Entire Tragedy
        James B. McNamara's confession clears up absolutely the tragedy ot
        the explosion and lire which, at 1:07 o'clock on the morning of October 1,
        1910, wrecked the plant of the Los Angeles Times, at First and Broadway,
        and caused the death of twenty-one persons. For nineteen of these "deaths
        the McNamara brothers were indicted, and I. B. McNamara was on trial
        specifically for the murder of Charles .1. Haggerty, a machinists whose
        body was found nearer than that of any other to the spot where the dyna
        mite was supposed to have been placed.
        Will Be Sentenced December 5
        Both men's sentences were set for December 5, when it is expected Dis
        trict Attorney John 1. Fredericks will ask for life imprisonment for James
        B. McNamara, the confessed murderer, and probably fourteen years for his
        brother. 'I lie men's lives are considered saved. The great contention that
        the Los Angeles Times was not dynamited is dead beyond resurrection or
        any argument.
        Tonight as the two brothers sat together in the county jail, refusing to
        see anyone or to make any statement, an interest second to the occurrence
        itself hung about the question with reference to James 8., "Why did he
        confess?"
        To this opposing counsel gave the same answer.
        Confessed Because of Guilt
        "He confessed because he was guilty, and that's all there is to it," de
        clared District Attorney Fredericks.
        "He was counseled to confess because that was the best thing he could
        do in opinion of counsel," said Attorney Clarence S. Darrow, chief of coun
        sel. "I will say now that there was no other reason or motive in it. I have
        studied this case for months. It presented a stone wall."
        Darrow's statement was made after looking square in the face of charge*
        that the recent arrest of Burt H. Franklin, an investigator employed by the
        defense, and two others with him, might have precipitated a situation un
        tenable, save by confession of the prisoner.
        Burns Still on Job
        CHICAGO, Dec. 2. —Detective William J. Burns left Chicago tonight to take
        up anew the trail he hopes soon to end with the arrest of every man con
        nected with the McNamara dynamiting gang. The detective refused to di
        vulge his destination, but it is believed he went to Indianapolis.
        Before his departure he intimated that the result of the guilty pleas
        entered by the McNamara brothers might mean further arrests in San Fran
        cisco. He refused to make predictions as to when the arrests would come,
        "Burns is still on the job," he said, with a smile, as he brushed a pile
        of congratulatory telegrams aside and picked up a telephone to give several
        last orders to subordinates in Chicago. "We've got the evidence —overwhelm
        ing evidence —to prove just who was concerned in this entire matter, and
        we 11 get the men before we quit. That's about all I can say."
        "That means the men who employed the McNamara gang that blew up
        the Los Angeles Times building?" was suggested. "Do you know them?
        "We know who they are. We know they will be arrested and others
        will be arrested who have a hand in the labor plots in connection with
        the Structural Iron Workers, Milton A. Schmidt and David Caplan, the other
        two men under indictment in connection with the Times explosion, will be
        arrested before we are done.
        Believes Others Being Protected
        "They are being protected right now by the McNamara defense, but
        they will be found. I know they are in this country."
        "Do you think the discovery of the jury bibery plot in Los Angeles had
        anything to do with the pleas entered by the McNamaras?" he was asked.
        "We have all the facts in connection with that plot," he answered,
        smiling. "We know all about it."
        The detective said the statement of Attorney Clarence Darrow to the
        effect that James B. McNamara declared he did not expect such a heav>
        explosion and insisted that force was greater because of a co-ordinate ev
        plosion of gas. was in keeping with the confession of Ortie McManigal, who
        helped commit the crime.
        Knew Part of Explosion Due to Gas
        "Why, McManigal told us in his first confession that McNamara turned
        open the stop cocks on ihe gas mains of the building when he set the bomb,'
        the detective said. "We knew all the time that a part of the explosion was
        due to the gas, but they had plenty of dynamite and nitroglycerine there
        to wreck the building, at that. They tried to buy 90 per cent, dynamite to
        do the job, and when told that 85 per cent, was the strongest they could
        buy, they got that. The statement that ten or twelve pounds of dynamite
        was all they had may or may not be true. They had hundreds of pounds
        at their command."
        Says Samuel Gompers Lied
        Speaking of Samuel Gompers. against whom the detective has the most
        bitter feeling because of the labor head's denunciation of the detective and
        his methods. Mr. Burns said:
        "Gompers knew from the first that 1 never made a 'plant' of dynamite,
        as he has charged. How do 1 know? Because Clarence Darrow told him
        so in Indianapolis immediately after the arrests were made. Darrow told
        him right then that Burns never 'planted' the dynamite and that 1 had
        a case."
        Fight Has Only Begun
        NE W YORK, Dec. 2.—"The fight has only just begun. This is only the
        lirst chapter. What we want to find out now is who were the men behind
        the McNamaras. and this we purpose doing."
        This statement was made today by Walter Drew, chief counsel for the
        National Erectors' association, which employed William J. Burns and his
        detectives to investigate the Los Angeles dynamiting case.
        "The McNamaras in pleading guilty have said that they were sent on'
        there and acted for a principle," Mr. Drew continued. "It is obvious that
        the men representing this 'principle' have kept them well supplied with
        money. It is to find out who these men are that becomes the important
        issue from now on."
        McNamaras Only Tools
        "The McNamaras," continued Mr. Drew, "were merely tools of a coteri.
        of men who attempted by force to coerce builders of structural steel an
        bridges into maintaining a closed shop and as hirelings they had no interest,
        whatever in committing murder or blowing up property further than to s
        j do their work as to draw their pay.
        "Their crimes are nominal compared to those committed by the men wh
        sent, them lo do these jobs and who paid for murdering men and destroying
        j buildings and bridges with high explosives.
        "These are the men we want, and I believe that when the Unite i
        States grand jury again assembles in Indianapolis events will transpire whit
        i will make the confessions of the McNamaras' puny by comparison."
        Mr, Drew told how, five years ago, his association had undertaken t
        put ait end to the dynamiting of its construction work, and how William
        Burns had been called in to work on the case.

        INDIANAPOLIS, Dec. 28. The government with stern, decisive
        swiftness today took into possession thirty-eight union labor officials,
        convicted of conspiracy in prompting explosions on non-union work through

        those convicted stands Frank M. Ryan, the president It was in this
        Union, with its twelve thousand members, that John J. McNamara was
        Secretary-Treasurer, while, he conducted the dynamitings out of which
        the present convictions grew.
        Today's convictions, on a scale
        unprecedented in a Federal court are
        the aftermath of the killing of twenty-one
        persons in the explosion of
        the Los Angeles Times. McNamara
        and his brother, James B., the Times
        dynamiters, convicted in California,
        are now in San Quentin penitentiary.
        Ryan and his fellow officials, the
        former associates of McNamara, are
        now Federal prisoners, awaiting sen
        tence. Two convicted, not affiliated with
        the Iron Workers, were found
        guilty of promoting the conspiracy.
        Sixteen minutes in all was the
        time required by the court to re
        ceive the jury, read the verdict of
        "thirty-eight guilty" and dismiss the
        jurors. The verdict brought to an
        end the history of the dynamite trial.
        It meant, except in the cases of
        Herman G. Seiffert, of Milwaukee,
        and Daniel Buckley, of Davenport,
        Iowa, the two found "not guilty,"
        that the government's charges about
        the dynamite plots extending, over
        six years, were sustained. I'meant.
        also, that thirty wives, -Inany with"
        their children, who -sat patiently
        through the long ordeal, would at
        last be separated from their hus
        bands. Important details yet remain in
        consequence of the verdicts. Pun
        ishments are to be imposed on the
        thirty-eight men by Federal Judge
        Anderson Monday morning at ten
        o'clock. The prisoners who receive
        terms longer than a year will be
        taken to the Federal prison at Leav
        enworth, Kansas. A special train
        will take them by a secret route.
        Details as to its leaving Indianapolis
        and arrival in Leavenworth will not
        be made public It is learned that
        United States Marshall Edward
        Schmidt, who is to accompany the
        prisoners, already had prepared for;
        the special which will leave as soon
        as possible after the sentences. A
        delay in the arrangement may be
        caused by appeals which may actj
        as a stay of execution of the court's j
        judgment.
        Thirty-nine and a half years is
        the maximum punishment for any
        one prisoner in this case. It may
        vary from the maximum to any
        shorter imprisonment or fine the
        court wishes to impose.
        Motions and appeals will be made
        Monday. Senator Kern, now in
        Washington and William Harding,
        another attorney for the defense,
        stated motions in behalf of all the
        men will be offered. District At
        torney Miller said he would oppose
        any appeals for light sentences in
        the cases of certain prisoners. To
        night the prisoners, four in each
        cell, otcupy two tiers of cells in the
        Marion county jail. The prisoners
        were handcuffed after the courtroom
        was cleared of spectators, and be
        teween deputy marshalls, marched
        five blocks through the streets in
        the brilliant winter sunlight to the
        county jail. An hour after their ar
        rival they were served the regular
        noonday meal, a half loaf of bread,
        tin of coffee, beef and cabbage. The
        prisoners, visible one to another
        through the bars were variously
        downcast and cheerful. Some pro
        fessed to take the verdict in light
        spirits, while disappointment was
        plainly written on the countenances
        of others.
        Extra guards were placed about
        the jail to prevent a demonstration
        by crowds. Wives and children of
        the prisoners were ordered with oth
        er spectators out of the court room
        where some wept when the verdict
        was rendered and attempted to climb
        the railing separating them from
        their husbands. Later in the streets
        they struggled through the crowds
        trying to follow their husbands to
        jail. All the afternoon .attorneys
        and women relatives .divided the
        time of the prisoners.
        President Ryan wss interviewed in
        the jail tonight. "I have nothing to
        say but this," said Ryan. "Greater
        men than we have been incarcerated.
        In olden time they cut off the ears
        of honest men."
        The Los Angeles Cases.
        LOS ANGELES, Dec 28. "What
        will be done with McManigal" was
        the question put tonight to District
        Attorney Fredericks who prosecut
        ed the McNamaras.
        "That will be a story for another
        day," Fredercicks answered. "He
        will be back here soon, but I cannot
        discuss him now. I will say though,
        that without his testimony and as
        sistance tLere would, have been no
        case at Indianapolis.''
        Federal officials said the three in
        dictments of four counts each which
        alleged the illegal transportation of
        explosives against Tveitmoe, Clancy
        and Munsey, returned a year ago
        here, are still in effect. Action has
        been postponed from time to time,
        awaiting the result at Indianapolis.
        They are now due to come up in the
        Federal court on January 13th, but
        their disposition either as to dis
        missal or setting for trial, depend up
        on the orders of Attorney General
        Wickersham. Anton Johannsen, the
        San Francisco labor leader, indicted
        here, but not at Indianapolis, will
        probably be tried here it is said.

        HISTORY OF THE
        DYNAMITE CASE.
        INDIANAPOLIS, Ind.. Dec 28.
        It was a scene blended with tragedy
        that confronted those who week
        after week sat through the historic
        dynamite conspiracy" trials.
        Now it was a baby crying from
        the rear of the court room, where
        the wives and children of the de
        fendants sat; now it was the heavy
        voice of a man seated in. the wit
        ness chair and defending .himself
        against the charges of a nation-wide
        conspiracy, in which officials of union
        labor were 'deeply concerned. Wit
        nesses from near and far came and
        went, but those whose fate rested
        with the jury remained there, listen
        ing to the accusations and to the
        oft-repeated story of the killing of
        twenty-one people in the Los An
        geles "Times" explosion.
        The court room itself seemed a
        fitting setting for that sombre story.
        Surrounded by great marble pillars,
        with the daylight shut out by heavy
        curtains, and the judge installed be
        fore an allegorical painting of Jus-
        tice, that court room day after day
        echoed the stories of violence, of
        the discovery of burnt fuses and
        bursted infernal machines, of mid
        night visits of mysterious men in
        alleys, in empty houses, in lonely
        country roads, or on the tops of
        buildings.
        The vision of a dark spectre with
        a bomb under his arm became a
        familiar image in the minds of those
        who listened.- Back of the railings,
        amid the spectators, sat the relatives
        of the defendants. Three rows deep
        across the room were the defend
        ants. Among the the score of at
        torneys sat perhaps the most pictur
        esque defendant, massive in build,
        florid in complexion, always studi-'
        ously occupied, now copiously filling
        his note-ljook when the testimony
        was exciting; now, when the trial
        lagged, burying his spectacled nose
        in a Latin version of Omar Khay-
        yam. He was Olaf A. Tveitmoe of
        San Francisco.
        Another in toward whom the
        eyes of the spectators often strayed
        was Herbert S. Hockin. He sat
        apart, between bailiffs, during much
        of the trial, for he had been branded
        by the court as. a man who could
        not be trusted by any one." It was
        Hockin who was named as having
        promoted the dynamiting business;
        it was Hockin who was accused of
        "holding out" on the pay of the
        dynamiters; it was he who was said
        to have caused a quarrel in the ranks
        of the McNamaras and McManigal,
        and it was he who finally was charg
        ed with betraying for his own gain"
        those with whom he once associated,
        and with whom he was affiliated in
        the iron workers' union.
        Gray-haired and old beyond his
        years sat Frank M. Ryan, president

        James B. McNamara, 59, who plead
        ed guilty to murder of one of the
        21 persons killed in the Los Angeles
        Times bombing October 1, 1910, died
        today in San Quentin Prison.
        McNamara and his brother, John

        sequent fire. John admitted dyna
        miting the Llewellyn Iron Works
        in Los Angeles Christmas Day, 1910.
        The late Clarence Darrow. chief
        of the McNamara defense staff, said
        James “was counseled to confess
        because that was the best thing he
        could do, in the opinion of his
        counsel.” James indicated he
        pleaded guilty to save his brother.
        "Joe (John) is not in on this deal,”
        he said.
        James w!as sentenced to life im
        prisonment. John was given 15
        years but was released after serv

        contracted under war and economic
        pressure, these regions lay on the |
        ancient east-west path of conquest.
        Once the hub of the vast domain
        of Alexander theGreat. Macedonia
        became part of the Turkish Empire i
        in the 14th century. Later, in the
        Balkan war of 1912. it was parti
        tioned between Bulgaria, Greece
        and Serbia: and still later tin post
        World War settlements'* it was di
        vided again between Yugoslavia and
        Greece.
        “Ancient Thrace, whose Greek
        section now extends south of Bul
        garia and west of Turkey to form
        the end of the Grecian panhandle,
        was invaded by Darius, Xerxes ar.d
        Philip of Macedonia. A Roman
        province, it was at various times
        also under the Goths and the Huns,
        and with the rest of the Balkan
        states fell to the conquering hordes
        of the Turks.
        “Like Macedonia. Thrace was for
        centuries a non-melting pot of con
        flicting nationals, where disputed
        boundaries, local economics, tradi
        tion and language combined to make
        for trouble between the assorted
        peoples who lived there.
        Prison records indicated he now

        McNamara served 25 years at San

      <text>Jerry Giesler, Courtroom Gladiator,
        Soothes and Saves the Harried Stars
        By JULIAN HARTT
        HOLLYWOOD (NANAI—
        The motion picture business
        didn’t know it at the time,
        but one of its best reasons
        for settling in the suburb of
        Hollywood could well have
        been that attorney Jerry
        Giesler already was here.
        For the past 30 years of As
        nearly half a century in prac
        tice, Jerry Giesler has been
        the courtroom marine corps,
        the legal gladiator, who has
        beaten back again and again
        those most terrible of threats
        to stardom: Shame, scandal
        and prison terms.
        Marie (The Body) McDon
        ald was the latest to utter the
        traditional movie colony cry
        of desperation—“ Get Giesler!"
        —when her account of kid
        naping and half-clad aban
        donment in the desert was met
        more with suspicion than in
        vestigation. And the mere
        fact that Jerry Giesler ac
        cepted the case brought in
        stant change. Officers who had
        spoken previously of possible
        “false reports" suddenly
        brought a measure of defer
        ence to that still-stalemated
        inquiry.
        Just who is Jerry Giesler?
        At first sight and sound, a
        courtroom spectator or pros
        pective juror might be inclined
        to smile, to feel that here is a
        successful but perhaps slightly
        too-dapper small-town busi
        nessman. He moves swiftly
        and purposefully into any
        room, usually wearing two
        tone shoes, that frequently in
        clude suede in their pattern.
        His portly figure is securely
        buttoned into a double

        and dammit. I want to bask in

        did.
        "I’ve been thinking about
        doing a play for a long time.

        off his snap-brimmed hat, he
        does it with the backward mo
        tion of a man who is conscious
        of the grooming of his thin
        ning hair.
        When he speaks, there is
        another surprise. His voice is
        thin, high-pitched and seem
        ingly always on the verge of
        cracking, but it never quite
        does.

        swiftly forgotten, however, as

        surance of full and complete
        frankness and honesty.
        In court he is the picture
        of dignity. No witness ever is
        heckled or badgered with sar
        casm. no matter how greatly
        the counsel might be tempted
        by the situation.
        For behind Jerry Giesler’s
        extreme courtesy is a keen
        mind, deftly leading the wit
        ness down a seemingly inno
        cent path of interrogation to
        the brink of disaster. His skill
        is such that fellow lawyers
        usually pack the spectators'
        section to watch and learn.
        Giesler was bom 69 years
        ago in the small community of
        Wilton Junction, lowa, and
        spent his boyhood in Musca
        tine. where his father was a
        banker.
        He had his law degree, but
        still was little more than a
        briefcase-carrier when, in 1910,
        the noted Attorney Clarence
        Darrow was charged with brib

        Men Made a Mistake,
        Eartha Kitt Declares
        Bv WILLIAM GLOVER
        NEW YORK, WP._"You
        men.” purred Eartha Kltt with
        a grin mixed of mischief and
        mockery, “made a mistake
        letting women get so far.”
        Broadway's sultry singer
        dancer arched up on her toes,
        stared intently in the mirror,
        flecked a hand over cheek and
        hair.
        She was busy explaining her
        first musical comedy. "Shin
        bone Alley" which officially
        opened last night), separating
        the off-stage Eartha from the
        on-stage Kitt, and comment
        ing on more or less related
        matters.
        "Women are too confused to
        have any philosophy other
        than a natural instinct for
        survival,” she continued, "but
        they're learning more than
        they used to.
        "Now they know how to.
        handle men—to neutralize
        them. That's where you men
        made a mistake."
        Catlike Grare
        Looking mildly pleased, she
        postured llthely into a new
        crouch on her chair. There
        was something faintly—and
        fittingly—feline in every word,
        tone and gesture.
        Miss Kitt's catlike grace and
        aura is being applied in
        "Shinbone Alley” to portrayal
        of the famous cat mehitabel,
        who along with archie the
        cockroach, was immortalized
        in the allegories of Don Mar
        quis. Archie is personified by
        Eddie Bracken in the show.
        Eartha firmly distinguishes
        between herself and her stage
        Incarnation.
        “I think mehitabel thinks

        ing a juror in the celebrated
        Los Angeles Times bombing
        case. During Darrow's trial,
        Earl Rogers, defending him,
        sent Giesler to look up a point
        in question.
        Both Giesler’s employer and
        the impressive client were
        amazed when he returned with
        40 pages of thorough research.
        In mid-trial Giesler was boost
        ed to associate counsel and
        made one of the attorneys of
        record.
        With the acquittal of Dar
        row, Jerry Geisler’s name was
        added to that of Rogers on
        the office door. But nearly
        two decades of broadening,
        seasoning in the catch-as
        catch-can field of high-pow
        ered criminal law cases
        remained ahead before Holly
        wood swept Giesler into its
        arms as its chosen advocate.
        There was the grimly re
        membered education of the
        Jess Willard case, when the
        fighter was tried on man
        slaughter charges after an
        opponent. Bull Young, was fa
        tally injured in a bout.
        Rogers had led Giesler to
        believe he would make the
        closing address to the jury
        right up to the moment it was
        scheduled, then announced:
        “Mr. Giesler will address
        the jury!”
        The Turning Point
        Without an iota of prepara
        tion. Giesler got to his feet as
        Rogers stalked out of the
        courtroom, leaving him in the
        make-or-break situation.
        Giesler began talking. He
        talked for three hours. And
        the verdict was “Not guilty.”
