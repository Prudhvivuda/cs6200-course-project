          NATIONAL
          REPUBLICAN
          CONVENTION
          Fairbanks for Vice President
          Is Now a Foregone
          Conclusion
          Opening and Organization of the Great
          Roosevelt Ratification Meeting
          Root Wildly Cheered
          Chicago, Juno 21. If there was
          doubt about the nomination of Fair
          banks, of Indiana, for vlco-presldent,
          We developments have set It at rest
          When Pennsylvania and New York
          fell Into line, the other boomlets did
          tot have a leg to stand on. Cannons
          forceful and picturesque expressions
          on the subject of his own candidacy.
          I settled the matter, so far as the New
          York scheme to nominate him was
          concerned. Roosevelt kept his hands
          out of the fight, but Cornelius Bliss,
          ho represented the President, was
          consulted, and acquiesced in the pro
          gram. There will be no fight in tho
          con?entlon, although there may be
          complimentary votes for a number of
          others, whose enthusiastic friends
          refuse to permit tho withdrawal of
          their names. Rebellious talk against
          the selection of.Cortolyou for the na
          tional chairmanship has almost en
          tirely iubsided, nor Is there longer
          tilt c a compromise, looking either
          to Oortolyous .selection, his .subse
          quent resignation, to accept the post
          master-generalship or looking to the
          selection of Cortelyou as chairman, of
          tie executive committee and choico
          of some one else to preside on the na
          tional committee Itself. Cortelyou is
          detained in New York on account of
          the Slocurm disaster, but is expected
          tere Wednesday. His coming, how
          erer, U11 have little effect on the sit-
          tatlon. The, hopes of tho tariff re
          idjusters for a revision plank in tho
          platform are doomed to disappoint
          ment, but little talk being heard fore
          shadowing the slightest concessions
          on the part of the stand-patters.
          But Western delegates continue tho
          sjitation against an anti-polygamy
          Pbnk, a matter In which delegates
          from Utah, Idaho, Colorado, Wyoming
          ud other intermountain common
          wealths are standing together. Anoth
          er fruitful topic for Westerners is the
          .statehood question, the last two con
          gresses having refused to carry out
          tho platform pledges looking to tho
          admission of Oklahoma, Arizona and
          New Mexico. The statehood boomers
          have not lost hope, and tho struggle
          will bo renewed before tho commit
          tee on resolutions.
          Roosevelt In the Saddle.
          Chicago, June 21. It is a Roosevelt
          convention now. Tho change has
          come with the arrival of tho great
          mass of the delegates, and thousands
          of hustling Republicans. Roosevelt
          badges galore adorn the coats of men
          to be seen on tho streets, men not reg
          Istered among the leaders and in the
          parlor conferences. Until Monday the
          anti-leaders held sway. They were
          tho old guard of the machine organi
          zation, whose own great purpose was
          to perpetuate their rule, some of
          whom were antl Roosevelt, and In
          whoso eyes tho President Is a politic
          al accident, and who bad1 to be given
          a renomination by force of circum
          stances. They threw cold1 water
          wherever Roosevelt sentiment ap
          peared, ignoring tho President in the
          convention arrangements, and had not
          thought of him in planning the decor
          ations. Most important of all, they
          decided, that one of their own selec
          tion should bo the new chairman of
          the committee, andi national leader of
          the party. Then it was that the Pres
          idents friends on the ground made a
          determined stand, Insisting that Cor
          telyou should have tho place. These
          Roosevelt men held their guns until
          tho army of delegates began flocking
          In Sunday night.

          Chicago, June 23. The last and
          greatest day of the Republican na
          tional convention was the apothesls of
          the big show, the climax to which tho
          events of the past two days have been
          the Introduction. Today Theodore
          Roosevelt was nominated to succeed
          himself as President, and Charles W.
          Fairbanks, senator from Indiana, was
          named as vice-president. With tho
          candllates of the party selected tho
          convention adjourned, tho delegations
          dispersing1 to spread into every re
          mote section of the country a conta
          gion of enthusiastic fever which has
          been enthused into them at this great
          gathering by the leaders of the grand
          old party of protection.
          This was a day of oratorical pyro
          technics. Somo of the finest speakers
          In the Republican organization were
          heard in common chorus in praise of
          the men who aro to lead the hosts to
          battle. Elated by tho ovents and the
          speeches of the last two days, and
          eagerly anticipating -the intellectual
          treat in store today, tho delegates be
          gan to assemble in tho convention hall
          early this morning. Becauso of im
          portant workin hand the convention
          was called to assemble at 10 oclock.
          Half hour before the floor presented
          an animated scene. Many delegates
          brought flags with them to assist in
          the demonstration which they were
          prepared to make when Roosevelt was
          placed in nomination. An increased
          interest in the convention was also
          shown In the galleries, which began to
          fill ns soon as tho doors opened at 9
          oclock. By tho time Chairman Can
          non called tho assembly to order near
          ly every seat was occupied, and short
          ly after standing room was at a pre
          mium. There was a larger proportion
          of ladies present than at either of the
          previous sessions, and their summer
          costumes lent a touch of color to the
          otherwise sombro rows of black coats.
          The first outburst of applause was
          ovoked by Margaret Elizabeth Plum
          mer, national organizer of the Ameri
          can Flag Asosciation, who was
          dressed in a stunning gown of cream
          colored silk, who surprised Chairman
          Cannori by presenting him with a
          great bunch of calla lilies, after mak
          ing a graceful little speech. Secretary
          Cortelyjpu was on the platform. As
          soon riS he mado his appearance many
          prominent leaders pressed forward to
          shake hands and assure him of their
          loyalty and assistance in the great
          work he is about to undertake as
          chairman of the national committee.
          Every membor of tho New York
          delegation, under instructions from
          Senators Plat tand Depow, was sup
          plied with fine silk flags, and their
          eritranco was greeted with loud ap
          plause Everybody arose while the
          band played America.
          Tho convention hall filled rapidly at
          an early hour, and every seat was
          filled when Chairman called it to or
          der at 10 oclock.
          Rev. Thaddius E. Snlvely opened
          the convention with prayer.
          Alabama yielded to New York on
          the call of states. Chairman Cannon
          then introduced ex-Governor Black
          amid great applause.
          At 10:41 a. m. tho clerk called tho
          roll of states for the presentation of
          the names of candidates.
          When ex-Governor Black finished
          speaking there was great applause,
          and the delegates were on their feet.
          Chairman Cannon stood on tho plat
          form with a tattered battloflag. The
          bands were playing, delegates were
          on their feet, and a massive picture of
          Theodore Roosevelt shown on tho
          platform brought forth renewed ap
          plause. The delegates of New York made a
          circuit of the hall, while the band
          played tho Star Spangled Banner.
          Chairman Cannon lead in singing
          the Star Spangled Banner, and the.
          band played A Hot Time in tho Old

          Senator Boveridge, of Indiana, sec
          onded Roosevelts nomination with a
          stirring speech, and the enthusiasm
          is on tho Increase.
          Chairman Cannon was compellod to
          use tho gavel a number of times to
          bring the convention to order.
          The entire audience is slpging Tho
          Star Spangled Banner, and there are
          no signs of order. Delegations with
          red, white and blue umbrellas are
          making a circuit of the hall.
          Tho convention was still shouting
          for Roosevelt when Chairman Cannon
          again appeared on the platform with
          tho tattered flag, which brought forth
          renewed cheers, and tho convention
          was in an uproar, and pandemonium
          reigned for somo time.
          Geo. A. Knight, of California, sec
          onded Roosevelts nomination on be
          half of the coast states.
          Harry Stilwell Edwards, of Georgia,
          seconded the nomination with a bril
          liant speech.
          Ex-Governor Bradley, of Kentucky,
          made a seconding speech.
          Hary S. Cummlngs, tho colored ora
          tor of Maryland, and Jos. B. Cotton,
          of Minnesota, followed with short
          speeches seconding the nomination.
          When New Jersey was reached
          they asked for unanimous consent for
          tho convention to dispense with furth
          er roll call and nominate Roosevelt by
          acclamation, but the Idea did not moot
          with favor.
          When tho roll call was ended no
          namo had been mentioned but that of
          Roosovelt, and ho received tho total
          994 votes of tho convention.
          In his characteristic stylo Senator
          Dolllver, of Iowa, placed Fairbanks in
          nomination. He paid a glowing
          tribute to tho policies of tho Republi
          can party, and to the leaders respon
          sible for tho exposition of these poli
          cies. Gradually hut adroitly he led
          up to his eulogy of tho Indiana
          statesman. Dollivers peroration was
          In the following werdB:
          While ho has not sought to con
          strain tho Judgment of tho conven
          tion, directly or indirectly, he lias
          kept himself free from affectation
          which undervalues tho dignity of the
          second ofilco within the gift of tho
          American people, and I do not doubt
          that his heart has been touched by
          tho volunteer expression of universal
          good will, which already has choson
          him a one of tho standard bearers
          for tho Republican party of tho United
          States. Tho ofilco has sought tho
          man, and ho will bring to the office
          the conmnding personality jot a states
          man equal to any of Jthe groat1 respon
          sibilities which belong to our public
          affairs.
          A leader of the senate and a cham
          plon of all great policies which constl
          tute tho invincible record of the Re
          publican party during tho last 10
          years, his namo will become a towor
          of strength to our cause, not only in
          his own state, but ovorywhoro
          throughout tho country. A man of af
          fairs, the wholo business community
          shares tho confidence which his polit
          ical associates have reposed in him
          from the beginning of his public life.
          Quiet, undemonstrative, and popular
          opinion, which has given tho Republi
          can party a platform upon which all
          Republicans stand, with no dissent
          ing voice hero or anywhere, has long
          since anticipated1 tho action of this
          convention in adding to tho national
          Republican ticket tho namo of Bona
          tor Chns. w! Fairbanks, of Indiana,
          and I take pleasure in presenting this
          namo honored everywhere throughout

          Sitting tilted back in a big armchair
          at his desk the President chatted freely
          and frankly with those about him. AH
          were his personal friends, and the Pres
          ident realized perfectly that the little
          confidences of the executive session,
          as he himself termed It. would be held
          as Inviolable. He talked and acted not
          as President of the United States, not
          President Roosevelt rose from his
          chair to receive the affectionate con
          gratulations of those about him. He
          was the most unconcerned, seemingly,
          of all. He chatted animatedly a few
          minutes with Mrs. Roosevelt, Miss
          Carew and Loeb, and then accom
          panied his secretary to the executive
          offices.
          ATTENDS. TO ROUTINE WORK.
          Outward indications that Theodore
          Roosevelt was to be chosen unanimous
          ly as the standard-bearer of his party
          absolutely were lacking at the White
          House in the morning. The President
          appeared at his desk at the usual hour
          and began immediately to transact rou
          tine executive business with Secretary
          Loeb. The important subjects disposed
          of, he received several visitors .for
          «hom engagements had been made.
          No members of the Cabinet called dur
          ing the early hours of the business
          day. The President was kept In close
          touch with the situation at Chicago
          through the press bulletins and private
          messages from the convention hall,
          which were received over a special
          wire at the White House.

          sentative In advance of its receipt over
          the special telegraph wire running from
          Chicago to the executive offices.
          At 1i:lZ p. m. the bulletin was given
          to Secretary Loeb. Some time previ
          ously the President had left his offices
          in the executive building and had gone
          to the White House for luncheon. Sec
          retary Loeb immediately conveyed the
          news to him there. Seated on the
          veranda of the White House, chatting

          ¦No vice chairman will be appointed,
          and the new chairman will divide his
          time between the New York and Chi
          cago headquarters, although some
          members of. the committee no doubt
          will be designated to take charge of
          the headquarters In this city. Head
          quarters will not be opened in either
          city until l the latter part of July.
          Meanwhile Cortelyou expects to select
          the executive committee and make his
          preliminary arrangements for the cam
          paign.
          s As soon as the committee was called
          to order, Postmaster General Payne, in
          a complimentary speech, nominated
          Cortelyou- for chairman, and the elec
          tion was made without a dissenting
          voice. Clayton of Arkansas, Murphy of

          journment of the national convention.
          2n thanking the committee for the
          honor, he told the members that, whHe
          he would be glad to have the benefit
          of their, advice and counsel, he in
          tended to be chairman in fact, and
          would accept no dictation from any one,
          high or low. He told them that the
          friends of the late Chairman Hanna
          were his friends, and he asked for
          the same measure of confidence and
          support that had been given to the

          wer standing in the aisles and back
          of the rows of seats. Former Gover
          nor Blacks introduction to make the
          Roosevelt nominating speech was the
          fcignal fop the first outburst of ap
          plause. Black led ud to the nomina
          tion by gradually defining: the type of
          man best suited for the partys color
          bearer. As he named Theodore j
          CROWD PACKS COLISEUM.
          When Senator Fairbanks had been
          nominated for Vice President there was
          no diminution in the demonstration.
          The voices were hoarse, but the shout-
          Ing was as general as it was for the
          head of the ticket.
          The delegates in their eagerness to
          exhibit approval of the nomination
          accepted every signal for renewed
          -cheering. A little colored boy from
          Georgia, and later a pretty little girl
          dressed in a dainty frock of white, were
          lifted to the platform, where they
          waved flags vigorously.
          At the conclusion of every seconding
          speech the outburst was repeated, and
          the speakers themselves were generally
          applauded.
          The chairman tired and his place was
          taken by a young man, who grasped
          the flagstaff firmly in one hand and
          with a megaphone led the yelling. He
          started to yell, Roosevelt, Roosevelt,
          Roosevelt, repeated over a^d over
          over again, with the system of a college
          yell. It was taken up by the throng,
          and the cry of Jioosevelt rolled over
          the hall in volumes so great and so ter
          rific that the screeching of a hundred
          steam whistrw v/ouid have been
          dwarfed in comparison.
          LIKE A COLLEGE YELL.
          When Governor Black of New York
          made his speech nominating President
          Roosevelt to succeed himself as Presi
          dent, the delegates in the Republican
          Convention proved there was no ab-
          Fcnce of enthusiasm in their ranks
          when occasion Justified an exhibition
          cf that Quality. For twenty-five min
          utes the great throng told its approba
          tion of the conventions choice for
          President. The name of Roosevelt
          came from every mouth. The New
          York delegates paraded the hall, shout
          ing at the top of their voices. Other
          delegations joined the procession, and
          the- weJ! ordered body of a half hour
          before was a shifting mass, every
          eemblance of organization gone.
          While the demonstration was at its
          height Chairman Cannon stepped to
          the front of tne stage. He held in his
          hand the banner which was waved in
          1SG0 when Lincoln was nominated, and
          •which fcas been used in every conven
          tion since. The flex showed the wear
          and tear of many similar contests.
          Uncle Joe wa\-cd It vigorously and
          kept time with his body. Soon the
          ¦whole convention was swaying in exact
          measure.
          1 rfiii^i by a resounding demonstration
          vbich attested the candidates great
          popularity. The charing was l=d by
          figures known through the breadth of
          the land and echoed by a mighty
          throne of enthusiastic men and radiant
          vomen assembled in the Coliseum to
          witness the crowning feature of the
          convention, as well as the close of th*
          rational meeting that marks the semi
          centennial of the Republican party in
          the United States.
          No less than 10,000 men and women
          participated in the ratification of the
          party programme and the consequent
          roar of cheering and handclapping was
          de&amp;feninp. The band, stationed high
          among tho girders of the hall, was
          browned by the tumultuous, unbounded
          demonstration. Hats were tossed into
          the air, State emblems were waved
          and flags beautiful, tri-colored, shim
          mering, silktn flags fluttered from
          every hand, as though stirred by a
          RIOT OF ENTHUSIASM.

          Lake Michigan.
          Geography counts but little with the
          sentiment and enthusiasm that is to
          day apparent in favor of one who is to
          be given all the honors anoTduties of
          an elected President of the United
          States, Knight said when silence was
          restored. Continuing in epigramatic
          style he thrilled the convention for
          many minutes. His voice never fal
          tered. His name was spoken in terms
          of congratulation on every side. When
          he had ceased, and with waving ban
          ners the California delegation marched
          to the platform to escort him to his
          seat, the great Coliseum rocked with
          the cheers of the multitude.
          Californias headquarters were in
          darkness to-night. The wines and fruits
          had been distributed among the fortu
          nate friends cf the delegates and the
          last toast had been drunk. Several of;
          the delegates have departed already,
          and more will go to-morrow. Within
          three days the last California delegata
          will have departed from Chicago.
          PARDEE GOES TO -T. LOUIS.
          Again the tempest broke. Out of the
          wilderness of silence had come a
          human voice. It had been heard and
          understood. The convention was over
          joyed: its enthusiasm must find vent.
          THRILLS THE CONTENTION.
          Knights voice reached to the farthest
          pillar and echoed back from the giant
          arches. With a howl of delight the con
          vention arose, and the waving flags
          with their crimson stripes were like a
          sea of flame. Speaker Cannon, with
          the gavel in his left hand pounding for
          order and his right uplifted command
          ing silence. wa3 ignored. For minutes
          the uproar continued. When silence
          came again Knight continued:
          ••Geography counts

          DELEGATION*. CHICAGO. June 23
          Californias triumph came to-day In the
          national convention. Her triumph was
          that of George A. Knight, th« eloquent
          lawyer of San Francisco. From 10:3*
          oclock until long after noon the per
          spirins delegates had been listening to
          the*disiineuished men of the East. Ex-
          Governor Black of New York had
          placed Mr. Roosevelt In nomination,
          and Senator Boveridge of Indiana had
          delivered the iirst seconding speech. To
          those in the rear galleries and side
          seats their efforts were nausht but
          mere pantomime. No sound strayed
          from a direct line in front of the plat
          form until Knight opened his masterly
          address.

          CHICAGO CONVENTIONS GOOD WORK

          This ticket was presented 1W live suffrages of the American people

          The nominations were unanimously made, and the proceedings were
          marked by a spontaneity of enthusiasm and heartiness of sentiment that
          augur the certainty of election.

          President and by Senator Jonathan P. Dolliver for the Vice-President,
          with the seconding speeches by Senators Bereridge, Depew, Foraker and
          others, were received with every demonstration of approval.
          When ex-Governor Black had named the President to succeed him
          self the enthusiasm was unbounded and the tumult of applause could not
          be stayed for twenty-three minutes by the clock.
          The same exhibitions of delight marked the presentation of the name
          of Senator Fairbanks for the second office in the #itt of the nation.
          Secretary Cortelyou was unanimously chosen a.s chairman of the
          National Committee, resigning as the head of the Department of Com
          merce and Lahor immediately after his election.
          The President received the news at the White House, and con
          gratulatory messages were interchanged between him and Senator Fair
          banks.
          The Committee on Notification, headed by Speaker Cannon, will
          officially inform the President at Oyster Bay on July 27. Another com
          mittee, headed by ex-Secretary Root, wiU wait on Senator Fairbanks in
          Indianapolis on August 8. f

          of the Danish steam er Norge, which
          foundered off Rochall reef June 28,
          h-was landed at Aberdeen, Scotland, last
          flight by the steam trawler Largo Bay.
          The contingent now being cared for
          rat Aberdeen consists of twelve pas
          sengers, the third mate of the Norge,
          the quartermaster, a steward, a lamp
          .trimmer and one of the crew. They
          drifted at the mercy of the Atlantic
          .for six days. When both water and
          food were gone, and when the occu
          pants were almost too exhaust ed even
          to hope, the trawler hove in sight on
          .Ju ly 4. They had eked out an exist

          When the survivors we re dragged on
          boa rd the trawler the fishermen we re
          i obliged foroibly to prevent them from
          eating and drinking too much.
          The third mate says that three other
          boats started with that rescued by the
          Largo Bay. One of those contained
          thirty-two persons, including several
          women and children. Another boat
          had fifteen men, with the second mate
          \in charge. The third boat had ten
          men on board. The survivors parted
          company with the three boats on
          July 3.

          tieth anniversary of the birth of the
          republican party under the oaks in
          this city July 6, 1854. It was here
          then that the first state convention,
          acting under the name of republi-
          can, was held. The state ticket
          nominated on that day went thru a
          heated campaign to election day suc
          cess.
          Secretary of State John Hay, who
          was private secretary to Abraham
          Lincoln, the first republican president,
          was the orator of the day. Other dis

          General Charles A. Blair of Jackson
          read a paper on the history of the
          republican party. Thomas J. OBrien

          was one of the participants in the

          An interesting feature of the exer

          for whom 1,000 prominent seats had
          been reserved. Grand Army uni

          were conspicuo us among them.
          The distinguished guests attended a

          Address of Secretary Hay.
          Soon after p.m. the program at the
          grove was resumed. Senator J. O.
          Burrows of Michigan introduoed Sec
          retary John Hay, the orator of the af
          ternoon.
          Secretary Hay reviewed the record
          of the republican party since its be
          ginning with the ability of a states
          ma n, a historian and an orator com
          bineW* Perhaps he, as no other man
          In the country, knows the history of
          the party. When it Is said,-therefore,
          that his review of the partys past was
          masterly, the word masterly
          all that it an mean as -so applied.
          Mr. Hay, passing from the history of
          the party to the present and imme
          diate future, said, in part:
          W are not claiming that we monopo
          lize the virue of the patriotism of the
          country There are good men all par
          ties, I know far better men than I am
          who are democrats. But we are surely
          allowed, in a lo\e feast like this, to talk
          of what has been done by the family and
          at least to brag a little of the democrats
          who have helped us. We come before the
          country in a position which cannot be
          successfully attacked in front, or flank,
          or rear. What we have done, what -we
          are doing, and what we intend to doon
          all three we confidently challenge the
          verdict of the American people The
          record of fifty years will show whether as
          a party we are fit to govern the state of
          our domestic and foreign affairs will
          show whether as a party we have fallen
          off, and both together will show whether
          we can be trusted for a while longer.
          7 means
          The 1004 Platform.
          Our platform Is before the country.
          There is certainly nothing sensational
          about it It is substantially the platform
          on which we won two great victories in
          the name of McKinley, and it is still
          sound and serviceable. Its principles have
          been tested by eight years of splendid
          success and have received the approval
          of the country. We stand by the ancient
          nays which have proved good.
          It would take a wizard to guess what a
          dainty dish our adversaries will set before
          the sovereign people tomorrow. One thing
          is reasonably sure: They will get as near
          to our platform as they possibly can and
          they will by implication approve everything
          McKinley and Roosevelt have done In the
          last four years. They will favor sound
          finance and a tariff which will not disturb
          business rigid honesty in administration
          and prompt punishment of the dishonest
          the Monroe doctrine and an isthmian
          canal. To be logical they ought to go on
          and nominate the republican candidates
          who are pledged to all these laudable poli
          cies.
          Roosevelt as an Issue,
          But they will not be logical. They an
          nounce* their plan of campaign to be not
          pro-anything, but anti-Roosevelt.
          Even on this issue they will dodge most
          of the details. Ask them, has the presi
          dent been a good citizen, a good soldier, a
          good man in all personal relations? Is
          he a man of Intelligence, of education?
          Does he Know this country well? Does he
          know the world outside? Has he studied
          law, history, and politics? Has he had
          great chances to learn, and has he im
          proved them? Is he sound and strong in
          mind, body and soul? Is he accessible and
          friendly to all sorts and conditions of
          men? Has he the courage and the candor,
          and the God-given ability to speak to the
          people and tell them what he thinks?
          To all these questions they will answer
          yes Then what is your objection to
          him? They will either stand speechless or
          they will answer with the parrot cry
          which we have heard so often: He is un
          safe!
          In a certain sense we shall have to ad
          mit this to be true. To every grade of
          lawbreaker, high or low to a man who
          would rob a till or a ballot box t$ the
          sneak or the bully to the hypocrite and
          the humbug, Theodore Roosevelt is more
          than unsafe he is positively dangerous.
          Coefficients of Safety.
          But- let us be serious with these good
          people. What are the coefficients of safety
          in a chief of state? He should have cour
          age the wisest coward that ever lived Is
          not fit to rule. And intelligence we want
          no blunder-headed hero in the White
          House. And honesty a clever thief would
          do infinite mischief. These three are the

          Mr. Lind himself is disposed to be
          philosophical, and laughs at the three
          hour squabble, but he to ok a most
          active part in it while it lasted. A
          for is friends, they are bitter in de
          nounci ng the Hearst men for turning
          down their old leader. The mildest
          term applied to the Hearst delegates
          is that they are crazy.
          The discussion la st night ranged
          over every Incident of the recent state
          campaign, which was fought over
          aga in in every gory detail. Frank

          Nomination of New Yorker Prob
          able, Tho Opponents May
          Defeat Him.
          From a Btaff Correspondent.
          St. Louis, July 6.The opening day
          oil the democratic national convention
          sees the situation as to the presiden
          tial nomination unchanged. Parker
          Is far in the lead and is nomination
          seems likely. A the same time,
          however, his prospects are no more
          favorable at this time than tho se of
          many a defeated candidate for the
          nomination have been before him and
          it may yet be possible for his enemieB
          to concentrate against him and defeat
          hi m. The fact that thjy are as actively
          at ~woric tod ay as at any previous
          time, and profess to be hopeful of,
          success, makes confident prediction
          that Parker will certainly be nomin
          ated somewhat unsafe.
          The trend of even ts is so distinctly
          toward Parker, however, as to indi
          cate his early nomination, possibly by
          the second ballot. If it were a betting
          proposition, I shou ld say the chances
          were at least seven out of ten in Park
          ers favor.
          Tammany is now acting as it did in
          1892, when it counseled against their
          renominati on of Cleveland, saying he
          could not carry New York. A form al
          statement of the Tammany position
          was giv en out in Chicago when the
          convention was in progress. The con
          vention disregarded the opposition ot
          Tammany and renominated Cleveland.
          It looks as if it would again disre
          gard this same opposition, and nomi
          nate Parker.

          to a noticeable degree. The great ma
          jority of the delegates and visitors had^
          provided themselves with fans and the
          auditorium viewed from the speakers
          desk was one yellow flutter, as th?
          palm-leaf fans bobbed back and forth.
          The delegates lost but little time in
          removing their coats, and the com
          plexion of the lower part of the hall,
          black at first, became lighter and
          lighter, as the ooats disappeared and
          the shirtsleeves became evident.
          The first ripple of applause that
          went across the convention came
          from the galleries when the Texas del
          egation marched In bearing their flag
          of red, white and blue, with the single
          star.
          A white silk banner beari ng the in
          scription* Florida democracy safe and
          sound, was borne into the hall short
          ly after the Texans had arrived, and
          was also greeted with applause.
          This was five minutes, before 12,
          and up to that time not a handolap
          had been offered to a ny man who had
          entered the hall. The platform was
          crowded with members of the national
          committe e, but the crowd paid no at
          tention to them.
          The Fhilippino delegation came in
          with their banner, which was not
          floating free like those that had
          tered before it. It was an American the cheers and cries fell, there would
          flag of Bilk wrapped closely arou nd
          the staff and tied hard and fast. This
          was done, aocordlng to one of the
          Philippine delegation, with deliber
          ate intent, as if to show that the
          democratic convention did not recog
          nize the Philippines as part of the
          nation.
          Chairman Guffy of Pennsylvania
          strode in closely behind t*ie Philippine
          flag and,WKs~1*eiR*trry

          Bryan Rose for a Cheer.
          Just as the California delegation
          reached its reservation after march
          ing up and down the center aisle, Wm.
          J. Bryan, who had come in unnoticed,
          arose in his place and was giv en a
          cheer. Then an enterprising member
          of the Montana delegation created a
          diversion by vigorously ringing a cow
          bell.
          Again Chairman Jones demanded
          that the conventi on be in order and at
          once directed the secretary to read the
          call for the convention.
          Applause followed the readi ng of
          the call. After quiet was restored,
          Chairman Jones announced that the
          convention would be opened by prayer
          by Rev. John Cannon, pastor of
          Grand Avenue Baptist church of S
          Louis.
          During the invocation the conven
          tion stood. Dr. Cannons voice was
          entirely inadequate to reach even the
          oenter of the hall. The prayer occu
          pied several minute s.
          Enthusiastio cheering greeted the
          chairman s announcement that he was
          directed by the national committee to
          appoint John Sharp Williams tem
          porary chairman and C. A. Walsh
          temporary secretary, and John Mar
          tin, temporary sergeant-at-arms.
          The chairman appoint ed Colonel J.
          M. Guffey of Pennsylvania and M.
          Harper of California to esoort Mr.
          Williams to the chair. A the plat
          form was inclosed by a railing, it
          was necessary for the committee
          and Mr. Williams to climb over the
          railing. The committee lifted Mr.
          Williams safely over and the entire
          conventi on burst into cheers as he
          ascended the platform.
          I have the honor to introduce to
          you John S. Williams as temporary
          chairman, said Chairman Jones, and
          again the convention cheered.
          Williams Speaks.
          Mr. Williams was attired in a light
          gray suit and awhite waistcoat.
          delivered his address calmly and with
          out gestures. Several cries of louder,
          louder, interrupted Mr. Williams as
          he began, his clear but not powerful
          voice at first failing to reach parts of
          the hall.
          A Williams proceeded, is
          voice increased in volume and the
          delegates listened attentively.
          Convention Amused.
          The convention appear ed consider
          ably amused at Mr. Williams humor
          ously sarcastic references to the mu-
          tual admiration society of Mr. Roose
          velt and Mr. Root, and when he read
          a eulogy by the president on Mr.
          Root, the delegates laughed and ap
          plauded.
          Mr. Willjpms spoke in an ironical
          tone that caught the fancy of the
          convention, and he was interrupted
          time and time aga in by laughter.
          Cheering was evoked by the speakers
          statement that Mr. Rooseve lt had
          found praise for only three presi
          dentsGeor ge Washington, Abraham
          Lincoln and himselfand when he
          asked if the hell-roaring Jake
          Smith order was a sample of the
          moral sentiment for which the repub
          licans stood, a lusty cheer broke forth.
          A great part of Mr. Williams
          speech was delivered under great dif
          ficulties, for the speak er and tho se
          of his heare rs who were suppos ed to
          be most directly interested in is re
          marks. The aisles leading past the
          delegates we re packed by dense
          throngs, who kept up a constant hum
          of conversation that smothered Mr.
          William s voice. Policemen who we re
          in the space arou nd the
          1stationed
          platform to keep others away, did it
          by occupying the space themselves to
          the exclusion of all others.

          times the speaker stopped and asked
          that the talking cease in order that
          he might make himself better under
          stood.
          Mr. Williams mentioned the name
          of Mr. Bryan in discussing the price
          of wheat during the first Bryan-Mo
          Kinley campaign. The utterance of
          the name called forth a little applause
          and some cheers. A second later
          mentioned the name again and the
          applause was not repeated.
          Cheer lor Cleveland.
          A mention of the name of Grove*
          Cleveland was cheered lustily. A mo~
          ment later the first scene of the ses-,
          sion occurred. Mr. Williams declared I
          that it was a brazen effrontery for the
          republican party to attempt to seize
          the laurels of Grover Cleveland. A
          genuine outburst of applause fo l
          lowed.
          Cheer after oheer rolled thru the
          hall, and altho the chairman used the
          gavel vigorously the convention was
          soon beyo nd his control. New Hamp
          shire delegates climbed upon their
          seats and yelled vigorously. One Iowa
          man of the Hearst-instructed delega
          tion from that commonwealth, stood
          up and waved his hat frantically, and
          a wild chorus answered him.
          Three chee rs for Grover Cleve-
          land, shouted an Alabama delegate,
          and they oame with genuine power
          and enthusiasm. N cry came from
          Nebraska, where Mr. Bryan and is
          friends sat. quietly, without taking
          part in the noise. Again and again
          the cheers came in dense volume, de
          spite numerous cries of order, and
          the strenuous pounding of the ohalr
          mans gavel.
          Then Mr. Williams sat back and
          watched the sce ne he had created. As,
          be a renewed outbreak and the dem
          onstration lasted eight minute s. f/^
          Brawl in Center.
          r&amp;
          Tim Murphy of St. Louis, standing
          in the center aisle and encouraging
          the demonstration, was first requested
          to take his seat and then ejected from
          the hall by John I. Martin, sergeant
          at-arms. Murphy wa^jrushed towarde
          the platform byr Martin thru a railing
          and down a narrow-stairway leading
          omder th* ^tage. i
          Another encounter between Murphy*
          and Martin to ok place in the passage
          way under the stage. Murphy then
          permitt ed himself to be taken from
          the hall by two officers.
          Murphy said that he endeavored to
          assist in securing quiet, but his efforts
          were misunderstood, a,nd at the direc
          tion of Sergeant-at-Arms Martin he
          was forcibly ejected from the floor by
          a policeman, and landed among the
          newspaper men. Here he endeavored
          to explain that he had been acting in
          the interests of quiet and order, but
          his explanations fell on a deaf ear,
          and despite his expostulations and
          threats, he was finally taken from the
          building by the police in charge of
          Captain Schroeder.
          For several minutes after the Mur
          phy incident the demonstration con
          tinued. Finally, In desperation, Mr.
          Williams threaten ed to discontinue is
          speech.
          You have placed me here, I am
          your servant. If you dont want me
          to continue, it is your pleasure, he
          oried.
          This announcement was effective
          and Mr. Williams secured control, the
          demonstration that his mention of
          Cleveland had caused, dying slowly
          out.
          When he said that he had heard
          that Dewey, Schley and Miles were
          democrats, that a .republican admin
          istration had snubbed the first, tried to
          disgrace the second and insulted the
          third, the convention aga in broke out
          into shouts and applause.
          William s Voice Falling.
          this time Mr. Williams* voice
          was failing. It grew weaker and he
          was heard with difficulty even by
          those very near the platform.
          Mr. Williams flow of oratory was
          uninterrupted for some time. A re
          sponse of applause followed his de
          nunciation of the republican claims of
          prosperity because of the tariff. Cries
          of louder were again heard in various
          parts of the hall.
          I wish I had the lungs to speak
          louder, but I cannot, answered Mr.
          Williams.
          What did you say? came a voice
          from the gallery.
          So rapidly did the noise Increase
          that Mr. Williams began to address
          himself directly to the persons on the
          platform. This brought forth from
          the galleries loud cries of time and
          louder. Mr. Williams, with all the
          voice left, turned to the audience and,
          with considerable feeling, took up the
          race question. When he referred to
          the incident at the republican con
          vention when a colored child and
          white child were both on the plat
          form waving flags during one of the
          demonstrations, there we re cries of
          This is a white mans country! ~$0&amp;
          Police Tried to Clear Aisles. g|
          So great did the noise become that
          the sergeant-at-arms went down into
          the hall and ordered the aisles
          cleared. But the police had difficulty
          in carrying out these instructions. Mr.
          Williams had by this time been speak
          ing an hour and twenty-five minutes.
          Now, a few words in conclusion,
          said Mr. Williams, and if you are as
          pleased to hear that conclusion as I
          am to conclude, this will be the most
          delighted audience that ever existed.
          Wiliams closed his speech at 2:05
          p.m.
          Mr. Williams devotes most of his
          speech to an arraignment of Presi
          dent Roosevelt, ex-Secretary Root and
          the republican party, chiefly by as
          sailing Mr. Roots speech as tempo
          rary chairman of the republican na
          tional convention, which, he says,
          was largely historical. Mr. Williams
          continued:
          It was to draw away attention from
          Rooseveltism and its volcanic, eruptive
          and reckless character by dwelling upon
          Several the fact that at some period of its history

          A Sweeping Victory for the Republicans.

          ocrats Elect Governors in
          Massachusetts, Minnesota and West Vir
          ginia----Republicans Retain Control of
          -House of Representatives.
          Special to The Times-Democrat.
          New York. Nov. .--Theodore
          Roosevelt was elected President
          yesterday for the term beginning
          March 4 next by an overwhelming
          majority in the electoral college and
          by a majority of the popular vote
          greater than that of any President in
          recent years.
          He carried every Northern and
          Western State, every doubtful State
          and everything but the so-called Solid
          South.
          He will have 325 electoral votes to
          151 for Judge Parker. Electoral
          majority for Roosevelt 174.
          His greatest plurality is in his own
          State- New York. At midninht the
          higures in hand indicated that he will
          have 2: .si votes more than Parker.
          His vote in Illinois. in Massachusetts
          and in most of the Western States
          was larger than that of McKinley in
          lipi. In every State.-that he carried
          he ran tylly as well as McKinley did
          four years ago.
          On the other hand. Judge Parker
          did not get as many votes in New
          York as Bryan did four years ago.
          and seems to have run behind the
          Bryan tote in all parts of the country.
          In 1872 the electoral vote was:
          Grant 292. Greeley and other Demo
          crats 74: Grants plurality 218.
          In 1892 it was: Cleveland 277. Harri
          son 1a5. Weaver Pop. 22: Cleve
          lauds plurality 112.
          In ln4i6 it was: McKinley 271. Bryan
          176, McKinleys plurality !g5.
          The Republicans retain control of
          the House of Representatives by an
          increased majority. The indications
          at midnight are that they will have
          from 20 to 230 members. They now
          have 210 members.
          It was apparent within an hour
          after the polls closed that Roosevelt
          had received a tremendous vote. As
          early as 61 oclock it was seen that his
          election was certain unless there
          should be some tremendous change.
          The returns at midnight indicate
          that about the bnly successes the.
          Democrats have had in the country
          are in West Virginia, Massachusetts
          and Minnesota. They elected their
          Governors in each of these States,
          although the Republicans carried
          them by increased majorities for, the
          electoral ticket.
          In most of the States where United
          States .senatorships were at stake the
          Republicans have elected their Legis
          latures. The Senators elected to
          begin their six-year terms on March 5,
          1905, will practically be in the same
          proportion as to party atlliatiod as
          those now sitting, thus continuing the
          Republican control of the Senate.
          At midnight William J. Bryan
          claimed Nebraska for the fusion can
          didate for Governor. This probably
          means that a fusion legislature has
          been elected. Bryan made his cam
          paign in Nebraska in the hope of secur
          ing the Legislature and his election to
          the United States Senate.
          In Wisconsin Gov. La Follette was
          elected over the Democratic and
          stalwart or bolting Republican can
          didates. The result on the Legislature
          is in doubt at midnight. Unless La
          Follete carries the Legislature he will
          not be able to put his taxation theories
          into effect.
          President Roosevelt announced at
          u oelock that under no hreuamstapees
          wi be be a eaadldste tavelection
          in loR. rThis leaves the held open to
          the many Republicans who have pre
          sidental asjpirations, including Vice
          President-elect FairbanKs. Senator
          Foraker and Secretary Taft of Ohio.
          Secretary Sliaw of Iowa and C-ove
