            <text>Sons and Daughters Unite to
                Commemorate Mothers'
                Day in the City
                How many of the Juniors have
                heard of JMiss Annie Jarvis?
                She is the Avoman who brought
                about the establishment of a
                "mothers' day" in almost every
                stale in the union, not to mention
                the nations of the world and
                whose indefatigable efforts have
                served to arouse in every man,
                woman and child a sense of the
                beauty of motherhood and the
                duty we owe to our mothers.
                Miss Jarvis is a Philadelphia
                woman. A few years ago, alone
                and unaided she started the
                "mothers' day" movement, and so
                eloquent was her plea that the
                idea found instant and hearty ac
                ceptance. Since then the plan has
                been gaining ground and within
                the last four years the setting
                aside of a mothers' day has been
                accepted and indorsed by nearly
                every governor in the union and
                many of the crowned heads of Eu
                rope.
                "Mothers' day" falls on the sec
                ond Sunday of May.
                Tomorrow is the day when the
                Junior boys and girls pay special
                court to mother. On all the other
                holidays, remember, mother pays
                special attention to you, but on
                the second Sunday in May condi
                tions are reversed a bit and moth
                er comes in for the lion's share
                of pleasures.
                See if you can't do something
                especially nice for her tomorrow.
                Show her how much you care for
                her and how very dear she is to
                you. Help.her with the work
                around the house, wait on her for
                a change and give her the benefit
                of her holiday.
                "Mothers* day" will be celebrat
                ed in many of the churches tomor**
                row, but that is not enough, boys
                and girls. It should be celebrated
                in your hearts as well. There is
                no one in all the world who will
                do as much for you as will your
                mother. When every one else has
                forsaken you and you haven't a
                friend on earth, your mother will
                stand by you with words of en
                couragement and love.
                See if you can't make her to
                morrow a very pleasant one in
                deed.
                The white carnation has been
                chosen as the flower symbolical
                of filial devotion and the florists
                are crowding their windows with
                the beautiful emblems of purity
                and love, for everyone's going to
                make a big bow to mother tomor
                row.
                Don't forget to wear a white
                carnation and wish mother the
                happiest returns of the day.</text>

                "White flower for Mother dead
                Bright flower for Mother living
                It was five years ago that Miss An-
                na Jarvis, of Philadelphia, con-
                ceived the idea of selecting one day
                of the year upon which the devotion
                to mothers' memory should be ob-
                served, and the second Sunday in
                May being the day upon which fell
                the anniversary of her mother's
                death, that day was chosen by her as
                Mothers' day.
                Miss Jarvis wrote to churches, so-
                cieties, public officials, noted people
                and the press and all joined in the
                movement which she had originated
                It has spread so rapidly that this
                year a majority of the governors of
                states have issued proclamations set-
                ting aside tomorrow as Mothers' day
                and suggesting that it be made one of
                the state's memorial days.
                The original plan was that each
                one wishing to honor his mother
                would wear a white carnation, but
                the demand proving greater than the
                supply, it was decided to wear a
                white carnation for the dead and a
                bright flower for the living So wear
                a flower tomorrow, white or bright,
                "in honor of the best mother in the
                world, your mother."
                The Nymore Road.
                At the railroad and warehouse com-
                mission hearing yesterday at Nymore,
                one fact stood out with startling dis-
                tinctness ^Every witness examined
                for Nymore testified that because of
                the j?oad between Nymore and Be-
                midji, loads coming to Bemidjl from
                IMHk Wl
                the country south and east of Ny-
                more had to be cut in two at Nymore
                and two trips made to coVer the last
                mile
                It is because of this condition,
                more than any other, that the people
                of Nymore are asking the commission
                to order a depot or depots built by
                the railroads A depot at Nymore
                will be a body blow to Bemidjl, as
                it will cut oft a tonnage revenue of
                about $10,000 a year, but if the com-
                mission orders one, Bemidji has only
                itself to blame The road should
                have been put in hist class shape
                long ago as it is one of the main
                traffic arteries to this city
                Foitunately for Bemidjl, the com-
                mission was taken to Nymore over
                the railroad tracks If it had been
                en over the road itself, it might
                have given a decision on the spot
                At any rate, whether or not the depot
                is ordered, the road should be put in
                first-class shape at once
                The Commercial club committee on
                highways was instructed last Tues-
                day night to prepare figures on the
                cost of paving the Nymore road
                These, with figures on the cost of
                making a sand or macadam road, are
                to be presented to the city council at
                its next meeting For several years
                past $150 to $200 per year has been
                spent on this road and it is nof much
                better today than when Chief Bemid*
                ji lived on the lake shore
                Not only the people at Nymore are
                asking for this depot, but the farmers
                living out in that country who have
                to use this road want better shipping
                facilities A paved street from Be-
                midji to Nymore would remedy the
                condition and remove a good cause
                for complaint

            <text>MISS ANNA JARVIS,
                Philadelphia woman, who originated
                "Mothers' Day," and secured national
                recognition for it.

                SPEAKER AT GUILD
                Miss Mabel T. Boardman Also
                on Program at National
                Convention.
                LONDON, May 7. The woman's suf
                frago bill was rejected last night by the
                house of lords by a vote of 1M to 60.
                Speeches in favor of tho bill were
                made by Baron Courtney, of Penwlth.
                the Earl of Lytton. and Baron Wll
                loughby de Broke, whllo Baron Wear-,
                dale, the Marquis of Crowe, and Vis
                count St. Aldwyn spoke against It.
                Viscount St Aldwyn said the argu
                ments for the extension of tho parlia
                mentary suffrage to women, which were
                based on the results obtained in those
                States of the United States where it had
                been' tried, did not apply in the United
                Kingdom, because in those States men
                were In the majority, while In the Brit
                ish Isles they were in the minority.
                Consequently, ho argued, the granting
                of the parliamentary vote to women In
                the British Isles would mean the hand
                ing over the destinies of tho country
                and of the empire to a female elec
                torate, which, he said, was a perilous
                step to take.
                Among those who voted for the bill
                were Viscount Money, of Blackburn:
                the Archbishop of Canterbury, and the
                Bishops of London, Hereford, Bangor,
                and St. Asaph.
                Those who voted against the bill in'
                eluded the Marauls of Lansdowne. Vis
                count Esher, the Marquis Salisbury, the
                Earl of Halsbury, and the Duke of
                Northumberland.

                Older Tlian Christianity
                Tho celebration of Mothers' Day,
                while new to us as a feast day, Is In
                history older than Christianity Itself,
                for Mother-worship with its rites and
                ceremonies dates back to tho days of
                the pagans when Cybele, tho Groat
                Mother of Gods, was idealized in
                Greece two centuries or more before
                tho coming of Christ. Later tho day
                111 HHHHHmBHSW'
                became known as tho festival of Hll
                arla and was hold on the Ides of
                March. As was tho custom of tho
                day, offerings wore made at tho tem
                ple." With tho advent of Christianity
                the festival was changed, and although
                It still Included many pagan customs,
                It becamo a celebration" In honor of
                Mother Church and was held on Mid
                Lent Sunday, or tho fourth Sunday In
                Lent On this day tho faithful came
                to bring offerings to Mother Church.
                Finally, tho day took tho name of
                Mothering Sunday, and was sot aside
                as-tho time when peoplo should pay
                visits to their paronts, especially to
                tholr mothers, also that they should
                carry with them some cako or trinket.
                "Going a-mothcrlng" soon becamo tho
                fashion and a certain kind of cako
                known as simncl cako was carried as
                a gift to tho mothor. Horrick, tho
                poet, In addressing one of tho char
                actors of his poem on Mothering,
                says:
                "I'll to thee a slmnel bring
                Gainst thou go a-mothering,
                So that when sho blessos theo,
                Half that blessing thou'lt give me."
                This proves that even In tho early
                days tho mothers' blosslng was highly
                regarded.
                In England tho slmnel cake3 woro
                composed of a crust made of flno flour
                and water with sufficient saffron to
                give it a deop yellow color and the
                interior filled with such ingredients
                as Is used In plum puddings. They
                aro boiled and brushed over with egg
                and set away to harden. When they
                are to bo used they must bo robaked
                and softened. This, custom was In
                vogue during tho seventeenth century
                when every child who resided away
                from homo was expected to carry a
                slmnel to his or her mothor. Fre
                quently tho cakes wero kept until
                Easter -and sorved ns tho desert for
                the dinner on that day.
                Early Celebrations
                Mothers' Day was first observed in
                1908 In Philadelphia by Bevoral of
                tho Sunday schoolB, and in 1909 about
                two thousand people took part In tho
                services. Seattle, Washington, how
                over, has tho honor of being tho real
                pioneer In a genuino Mothers' Day
                celebration. This was In 1900 when
                hundrods of peoplo gathered in tho
                churches of that city on tho second
                Sunday In May. They carried bou
                quets and wreaths of flowers and at
                the closo of sermons on "Mothor
                Lovo" tho entire congregations hold
                tholr flowors aloft whllo tho pastor
                pronounced a blessing, and at the
                closo of tho service tho flowers were
                gathered together and placed on the
                graves of mothers whoso relatives
                wero not in tho city to perform this
                loving service.
                In 1910 tho Governor of tho State
                of Washington set asldo tho eighth
                of May ot that year as Mothers' Day
                for that Stato, and over slnco that tlmo
                tho proclamation of Mothers' Day has
                been issued with tho samo regularity
                as that of Thanksgiving. A request
                is also added that each person wear
                a whlto flower on tho day and that
                special services should bo held in tho
                churches.
                Tho Stato of Oklahoma was the next
                to fall in lino wltha Mothers' Day
                proclamation, whon Governor Leo
                Cruco in 1912 paid such a glowing
                tribute to motherhood in his procla
                mation to tho peoplo of that Stato:
                "Each citizen, whether old or
                young, rich or poor, happy or -sorrowful,
                remember her whoso
                lovo passeth human understand
                ing, and remembering, manifest
                to tho world your lovo nnd gratl
                tudo by wearing a carnation In
                honor of tho dearest of all moth
                ers, and wearing It, think of her
                and love her."
                Slnco that tlmo many Slatos have
                followed the example of these two.
                Western States, and at present tho day
                has takon-'H prdrrfihent plnfo among
                our feast days. Sermons aro preached
                on tho subject of motherhood in the
                majority of our churches. Tho Sun
                day schools have a Mothors Day ser
                vice, and In tho afternoon many go
                out to tho cemotories to cover tho
                gravo of "man's best friend" with gar
                lands of flowors.
                Mothers' Pensions
                Tho celebration of Mothers' Day
                has brought about a stronger feeling
                on tho subject of pensioning mothers,
                and ono Is surprised to learn how
                many States havo already adopted tho
                pensioning system for mothors who
                aro too poor to properly caro for their
                chlldron. Whllo the plan is too now

                a homo is less likely to turn criminal

                Mother Influence on Statesmen
                Tho significance of Mothers' Day
                should find an echo in every heart,
                for It was tho mothors of our Statos-
                Imen who Jn the early days put our
                'Nation on a 'firm foundation "The
                hand that rocks the cradlo Is the hand I
                that rules tho world." It was tho
                mother of Georgo Washington who,
                by hor woman's intuition that ho was
                mado for better things, saved him
                from becoming a midshipman on a
                British ship. It was the turning
                point in tho life of tho Father of his
                Country whon rather than causo his
                mother sorrow ho roturnod his middy
                uniform and said "Mothor I can never
                go and cause you so much grief. I
                will stay at homo." With Washing
                ton In tho British Navy thero might
                have been no Monmouth and no York
                town. Tho character of Androw Jackson's
                mother stands out in Amorlcan his
                tory like a speck of blue in tho dark
                sky of those early days in tho moun
                tains. Her advice to her son Bhows
                the wisdom of Polonlus and may well
                bo treasured by tho man who desires
                to succood. Jackson never forgot hor
                words of advice and a short time be
                fore his death he repeated her part
                ing advice to a young man in whom
                ho was interested.</text>

                By JOHN DICKINSON SHERMAN
                OTHER'S Day should be
                celebrated 365 days In
                the year. There's no
                need to argue about it.
                Every man and woman
                blessed with a good
                mother knows it's true
                and knows why it's true.
                It doesn't take a very
                old child to understand,
                either.
                But, since human nature is human
                nature, every day isn't observed as
                Mother's Day. There is all the more
                reason, therefore, for observing the
                second Sunday in May May 14, this
                year with a real celebration. Some
                one has tried to figure out a real cele
                bration after this fashion for sons:
                Wear a flower in mother's honor
                a white one if mother is dead; a col
                ored flower for a living mother.
                Send mother a box of spring flowers.
                Write her a letter a long one.
                Give mother a whole day of your
                time for that "good visit" she longs
                for.
                Send mother your picture, and snap
                shots of your home, your children,
                your work.
                Tell mother, your plans and ambi
                tions she made them possible.
                Tell mother your smaller troubles
                she wants to help you.
                Thank mother for her care and her
                teachings tell her how they have
                helped you.
                Don't forget that mother still likes
                candy.
                Mother was your first and truest
                sweetheart don't forget to say "I
                love you I"
                For the daughters these things are
                suggested
                It's your chance to say "thank you"
                to your best friend your mother.
                Be sure to celebrate by wearing a
                flower for mother: White for mothers
                not living; colored flowers for mother
                still with you.
                Send mother some gay spring flow
                ers, a brilliant bouquet or a thrifty
                plant.
                Make a dainty cap or a "dress-up"
                gown or shirtwaist as a love gift to
                mother.
                If mother is far away, send her a
                "special delivery letter" for her Sun
                day treat.
                Send mother the book you just en
                Joyed reading.
                Don't forget to send her pictures of
                yourself, your friends and your good
                times.
                Tell mother your small joys and sor
                rows and ask her advice It will be
                good.
                Ask mother to tell you about her
                girlhood you'll both enjoy it.
                Mother is a gin too. She likes pretty
                things, love, laughter and compliments.
                Give her some.
                The spirit of this celebration is
                right enough. The letter of it fails.
                Nobody can tell you how to observe
                Mother's Day.. You know. If she's a
                red carnation mother make her happy.
                If she's a white carnation mother, do
                something that would make her happy
                if she were a red carnation mother.
                Nobody can draw up a celebration
                schedule for Mother's Day. How can
                one, when nobody can find adequate
                words to write about Mother's Day?
                Mother's Day is something new In
                the way of holidays not like Christ
                mas and Easter which are old, old
                holidays. And It's new, compared with
                the Fourth of July. In fact, It's just
                about the newest holiday we have.
                It was no longer ago than 1906 that
                Miss Anne Jarvis of Philadelphia, hon
                oring the memory of her own mother
                on the anniversary of her death, con
                ceived of a day of which everyone
                should do reverence to his mother,
                whether living or dead. The World's
                Sunday School association adopted the
                plan, and, in the next few years, an
                nually designated one Sunday as
                Mother's Day. The purposes of this
                celebration, as stated by Dr. George
                W. Bailey, then president of the asso
                ciation, were:
                "To recall the memories of the
                mothers that are gone, and through
                loving words and loving care to
                brighten the lives of the mothers that
                remain, and to help children, men and
                women to a greater blessing in honor
                ing their fathers and their mothers.
                "To recall mother's prayers, moth
                er's dying words, and the promises
                made to mother by the big boy that
                still mourns her, and to stop and think
                a little of what she was in her life to
                her family."
                In 1908 Miss Jarvis founded an or
                ganization now known as Mother's Day
                International association.
                The idea was taken up by the states.
                In 1910 the governor of Washington
                Issued a proclamation designating
                May 8 of that year as "Mother's Day"
                and urged It be celebrated by special
                services and the wearing of a white
                flower in honor of all mothers. In 1912
                the governor of Oklahoma issued a
                similar proclamation.
                National recognition was given
                Mother's Day by resolution of the
                Sixty-third congress, approved by the
                President of the United States on May
                8, 1914, designating that the second
                Sunday in May thereafter should gen
                erally be known as "Mother's Day,"
                and directing that it should be the
                duty, of the President to request its ob
                servance by Issuing a proclamation
                calling upon the government officials
                to display the United States flag on
                all government buildings, and the peo
                ple to display the flag at their homes
                or other suitable places on this day,
                "as a public expression of our love
                and reverence for the mothers of our
                country."
                Originally the white carnation was
                the flower worn in observance of the
                day. Then, the public settled on white
                carnations for mothers dead and ted
                carnations for mothers living; then on
                white flowers and colored flowers.
                Now the tendency is to wear "mother's
                favorite flower."
                The great of the world have been
                proud to pay tribute to mothers.
                Unhappy is the man for whom his
                own mother has not made all other
                mothers venerable. Rlchter.
                A man never sees all that his mother
                has been to him till it's too late to
                let her know that he sees it. W. D.
                Howells.
                If you would reform the world from
                its errors and vices, begin by enlisting
                the mothers. C. Simmons.
                I think It must somewhere be writ
                ten that the virtues of the mothers
                shall be visited on their children, as
                well as the sins of the fathers.
                Charles Dickens.
                The loving sacrifices of motherhood
                must burn on the altar of undying
                faith. If I could bequeath but one
                priceless heritage to youth, it would
                be the ability to know the full measure
                of her love. Her Influence is the most
                changeless thing in the fiber of a
                man's character. It outweighs arts,
                science, literature and philosophy, for
                her faith and works are better than
                all the wise man's knowledge. Sena
                tor Lawrence T. Sherman.
                Then there Is the Gold Star Mother
                and the Mother in Time of War oh,

            <text>MOTHERS DAY TOMORROW! U. S. TO RE
                SOUND WITH PRAISES AND PRAYERS FOR HER
                Miss Anna Jarvis, the "Mother" of Mother's Day.
                Mother will be QUEEN tomorrow.
                She will be the sweetheart of the
                world.
                The carnation, symbol of maternal
                love, will be the national flower for
                one day at least
                In churches, in homes, in prison
                cells, in hospitals, in the harvest
                fields of the west and in the slums of
                the east, every one will pay tribute
                to MOTHER or to MOTHER'S mem
                ory. Miss Anna Jarvis of Piladelphia is
                the "mother" of Mother's day. Eight
                years ago she invited her friends to
                Join her on May 9 in commemorating
                the death of her mother. The annual
                tribute to mothers, which is now a
                world-wide custom, was the Outcome
                of that little meeting.
                The official program arranged by
                Miss Jarvis for the celebration of
                Mother's day includes the Mother's
                day prayer, the proclamation of the
                president recognizing Mother's day,
                James Whitcomb Riley's poem on
                Mother's day and the singing of na
                tional anthems.</text>
