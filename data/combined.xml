          Indianapolis, May 30 Collision, death,
          serious Injury, dementia, and panic were
          features of the International 500-mile au
          tomobile racing at the' Indianapolis Motor

          over Harroun as he passed under
          the wire, thus declaring him the
          winner, the crowd went wild,
          rushed out on the track, took the
          driver from his car, and carried
          him about the course on their
          shoulders.

          The time for the 500 miles' Was fl 8.
          an average of close to seventy-five miles
          an hour for the entire race, as figured
          by the official scorers During the last
          twenty miles of the race one of the con
          tenders for the leadership was Joe Daw
          son Tire trouble caused some delay, and
          he was forced to stop at the pit. A
          part of the time during the last twenty
          miles Harroun, Bruce Brown, and Mul
          ford were almost bunched for the lead.
          Brown and Mulford alternated in getUng
          second and third places, and not once
          did they head the lightning Harroun.
          During the last ten miles of the race
          the excitement throughout the grounds
          was intense, and bets were freely made
          on the three men then in the lead, Mul
          ford being the favorite up to the begin
          ning of the last lap The drivers were
          hltUng up a speed estimated at" more
          than eighty miles an hour, and averaging
          on the whole a speed of close to seventy
          Ave miles an hour, which Included the
          stops Ray Harroun. Ralph Mulford.
          Bruce Brown, and Joe Dawson, in a Mar
          mon, were running almost a neck-to-neck
          race, about one lap separating the four
          drivers
          Harroun was in the lead at 450 miles,
          with Mulford less than a half lap be

          Flat. No 18, which had stopped because
          ef tire trouble. Knight's car crashed into
          them with such terrific -fcrce that both
          16 and 35 were dragged along to the road
          way opposite the gate. The impact
          caused No. 7 to turn over, throwing
          Knight and his mechanician some dis
          tance. The accidents occurred within a few
          feet of a crowd of people, who were
          panic-stricken at the danger and rushed
          for places of safety. Many of the peo
          ple were so filled with terror that they
          cried from excitement and several hun
          dredleft the grounds.
          The accident to the Amplex that re
          sulted In the Instant death of Dickson,
          wrought up the crowd, and when Lozier,
          No. 24, driven by Tetalaft, was seen to

        <text>The eyes of the motoring public
          were focuped last week on the
          Indianapolis speedway, where
          records galore were establish
          ed and for the first time in
          the history of the automobile a *00-mile
          race was successfully run ofT and an
          American, in an American-built
          proved the victor in the great interna
          tional sweepstakes race. Although
          race was not without its death toll-one
          being killed and seven injured still
          fact that more were not kille seeme
          wonderful- Even the one death recorde
          might have been avoided had a few
          seconds been taken to securely fasten a
          loose rim. As it was the rim flew oft
          and as a result a mechanician on one of
          the cars was killed. The driver of the
          car admitted after the race that the rim
          was loose when his car was called to
          the starting line and there was "no time
          to tighten it." Besides betting on favor
          ites in the big race promoters even, went
          so far as to wager on the number of
          those participating in the event who,
          would meet with death in the long grind.
          The winning car-a "Marmon Wasp,
          piloted by young Ray Harroun, traveled
          the SOO miles at an average speed of 74..7,
          miles an hour. It Is a world s record
          for sustained automobile travel. The,
          only performance with which It can be j
          compared Is the twenty-four-hour world's
          record made by S. F. Edge on the famous I
          cement track at Brooklands. England. In j
          that event he covered 4i4 miles in trie
          first seven hours, as against Harroun t j
          {Km miles in nineteen minutes less. The
          race took place on Decoration day and
          was attended by nearly 8.1,000 persons.
          The number of cars starMng in the event
          was forty, the largest field ever witnessed
          on a track or speedway In America.

          On the day prior to the 500-mlle race
          "Wild Bob" Burman. in his powerful JTO
          horsepower Blitzen Benz. set up new fig
          ures on the Indianapolis speedway for
          the Quarter, half and mile distances,
          a new mark for the kilometer as well.
          While Burman was cleaning things up in
          his own masterly fashion. Barney Old
          fiHd. who held the title of "speed king
          prior to "Bob" entering the field, sat
          quietly in the grandstand and watched
          the records go by the boards. Burman
          used the same car which Oldfield used
          when he established the records which

          were broken last week. The mile record
          was lowered from 35.63 to 35.3B. The new
          quarter-mile record Is 8.16. and for the
          half-mile. 16.83 seconds. The kilometer
          now stands at 21.40, as against 21.46
          made by Oldfield. Burman Is now enti
          tled to the honor of "speed king." which
          honor came to him a few weeks ago at
          Daytona Beach. Fla.

          A word or two about the new record
          holders at this time would not be out of
          place. in view of the wonderful feats
          which they have performed behind the
          throttle.
          Robert Burman, acknowledged "speed
          king." is but twenty-seven years old.
          Bom near Imlay City. iMich., In 1S84, Bur
          man lived on the farm until about ??v
          enteen years of age. Then he went to
          testing automobiles, and tested the first
          car ever made by the Buick Motor Com
          pany, when the factory was located at
          Jackson. Mich. iAter he entered the em
          ploy of the Jackson Automobile Company,
          and soon became head tester. While he
          was thus employed a freak racing car
          was built in Jackson, and the builder In
          vited Burman to a five-mile match race
          on the mile horse track at the fair
          grounds. Burman took the chance of be
          ing shown up. and won the race by al
          most a mile.
          This started the speed career of the pres
          ent monarch of them all After much per
          suasion and the ofTer to pay hit own ex
          penses if the company would let htm have
          a car he was allowed to enter a tifty-mile
          race at Detroit in 1106. All of the big
          bovs of the game were in, but Bob start
          ed out to "beat it." and won the race
          hands down. His next experience was to
          drive twenty-two and a half hours of a
          twenty-four-hour race In St. Louis the
          same year and win by eiKhty-two miles.
          Then the Buick company got him and
          his career which gained him the name of
          "Wild Bob" started. He was but twenty
          three years old, but he proved hi? ability
          and his nerve, and hip promotion was
          fast. A list of Burman's winnings would
          fill a fair-sized volume. His most notable
          victory of 1910 was first American car
          in the Savannah grand prize race and
          third in the race. He won several long
          races at the Indianapolis motor speed
          way in July, 1010, but the disqualification
          of the Marquette-Buick cars loscredits he gained by clever driving.
          Burman left the Buick team early this
          year to drive the cars formerly owned by
          Barney Oldfield. He immediately drove
          the Ji*-horsepower Blitzen Benz faster
          than Oldfield ever had dared, thereby
          breaking all records for the kilometer,
          mile and two-mile distances. The rec
          ords made by Burman in the Benz at

          Perhaps a number of manufacturers
          and o* tiers in the industry do rot fully
          realize what tiie Canadian reciprocity
          agreement means. It is of far greater
          importance t' the automobile industry
          than t'le avertge man imagines. The
          reduction of duty on American-made
          cars from 3."? to :;o per cent opens up a
          wider channel for American goods to
          flow across the border, and brings a rich
          market for cars closer to our door.
          According to turer, Canada, within the next few years,
          will be buying loads of cars of the
          utility type for use in its vast grain re
          gion. When one stops to think that in
          the United States more than 80,000
          farmers use automobiles, and that hair'
          of these are grain producers, who find
          noicr tars economical in their business,
          it is not difficult to foresee that Canada,
          with its enormous- grain industry, the
          vastne^s of wpich scarcely can le con
          ceived. shorti.* will follow suit and adopt
          the motor car en a much greater scale.</text>

          on by the richest prizes ever of'ered
          in aU'omobile speed competitions,
          and driving the speed creation or
          the most brilliant engineering minds
          of Europe and America, the drivers
          entered in the second annual' 500
          mile race at the Indianapolis motor
          speedway will begin their long jour
          ey around the brick oval at 10
          o'clock next Thursday morning.
          For the second time In the history
          ot the world's greatest race course
          the five-century contest for cars un
          dep 600 cubic Inches will be offered
          to the speed lovers and the sporting
          Inclined followers of the automobile
          game In the United States.
          This is the greatest of. track 'races.
          The first 500 mile event on Ithe vitri
          fied oval at Indianapolis astonished
          the world, and Ray Harroun In nis
          Marmon Wasp was the hero of the
          nearly seven-hour speed combat. The
          first race taught the speedway man
          agement, the engineers, the drivers
          and last but not least, the public.
          The second race will astonish the
          world. The greatest drivers on this
          side of the Atlantic are entered and
          many of them participated In the
          first event. The cars are faster than
          In 1911. The requirements of the en
          try conditions were much more strin--genlt
          The facilities for handling the
          largest number of people that will
          witness a sporting event in 1912 are
          much improved over the 1911 condi
          tions and Indianapolis people by co
          operating with the speedway man
          agement and the hotels will be able
          to easily handle all Its guests.
          The motor speedway, at a cost of
          $650,000, has substituted a tunnel for
          the old foot bridge just north of the
          pits. This will facilitate the hand
          ling of the autos that are parked In
          the infield and the vast crowds that
          will view the race from this enclos-
          lirp. Thfl Ifnnnpl lu Inaf r.t-K rt f ia

          sage of two motor cars at tbefaame
          time, going in opposite diraftions,
          and also provides two passages for
          pedestrians elevated above the ve
          hicle passages.
          The pits at the south end where
          Harry Knight pushed his Westcott
          into the wall to escape crushing the
          Case mechanician, Anderson, last
          year, have been fitted with concrete
          walls like the other' pits in place of
          the former wooden partitions.
          The speedway has in every way
          perfected its arrangements to make
          safe every possible angle of the, race.
          The track has been gone over care
          fully and smoothed 'out. The driv
          ers were instructed Monday night
          at 8 o'clock, in a meeting at J:he Clay
          pool hotel by the A. A. A. officials in
          charge of the race, and cautioned to
          be vigilant at "all times. An elaborate
          signal system for use in emergencies
          on the track has been worked out.

          Only the cars that comply with the
          entry requirements iu every particu
          lar will be allowed to face the sturt

          Chief Timer C. H. Earner and his

          minutes flat or at a speed of
          miles an hour for two and one-half
          miles.
          This afternoon at 1:30 o'clock the
          cars began to weigh in. This re
          quirement is 2,000 "pounds or over.
          All steering knuckles, front axles
          frame hangers and steering mechan
          ism, including tie rods, will be sub

          fin, famous as engineer and builder
          ot the Hudson car and the mechani
          cal engineer of the speedway. These
          details prove to the layman that the
          first race demonstrated to the speed
          way and the motor car designers and
          builders the necessity of the precau
          tions in running, a race of such a dis
          tance. Not only will the race for 500 miles
          be the longest track,, event in 1912,
          but it will also offer the largest
          amount of cash to the drivers of the
          modern spaceaters. Fifty thousand
          dollars is offered to these men who
          will catapult their cars through space
          for more, than six hours in an effort
          to cross the Jape first with 200 laps
          to their credit.
          The winner will receive for his
          probably six and one-half hours' ex
          ertion, the modest sum of J20,U00,
          while Ray Harroun, the winner of
          the-first race, drew down 10,000. In
          addition to this amount ot cash of
          fered by 'the speedway the various
          accessory manufacturers interested
          in the race have offered cash. The
          following amounts will be given to
          the next eleven drivers in the order
          tha tthey finish: $10,000; ?5,000; $3,

          "and that's all. I made, the race while

          Tire service played an important

          MATIONAL'S RACE
          P* IS POPULAR HERE
          By LEON J. PINKSON
          THE National's decisive victory in
          the Indianapolis speedway raoo
          yesterday was received with much!
          joy in local motoring circles. To be j
          sure, much sympathy was expressed fc
          De Palma. who lost the $10,000 puree
          when victory seemed certain, but the j
          fact that an American built car came j
          in the victor and set a new world's j
          record overshadowed the misfortune of i
          De Palma and his Mercedes and aroused I
          THE SAN FRANCIJStJO^OAI^L/ FiiIDAY, MaY 31, 1912.
          the truly patriotic enthusiasm that
          goes with Amerlpan success.
          Interest in the race was at a hlfb
          pitch throughout the six hours it was
          being run, and the bulletins that drifted
          from the race course telling of the
          shifting of places among the fast mov
          ing cars were devoured with keen
          eagerness. Most of the principal cars
          in the big race are represented here
          and the headquarters for the respect
          ive machines were the centers for
          emwds of zealots who gathered to learn
          of the progress of the race.
          That a new world's record was set
          was not a surprise, for it was gen
          erally conceded that the entries this
          year were the faatest cars that were
          ever matched. The victory of tRe Na
          tional car was also no particular sur
          prise, for the car was frequently men
          tioned as one of the most probable
          winners, judging from the fast time the
          entries were making in the tryouts.
          At the headquarters of the Howard
          Automobile company, distributer* for
          the National, the news of the victory
          was received with wild delight. Gep

          eral Manager Tt. K. Roberts of the
          company was most joyous over the suc
          cess of the car because of the fact that
          he had freely predicted a National vic
          tory, and Dawson's car was .the very
          one in which he made several circuits
          of the speedway track during his recent
          visit in Indianapolis. On this'oocasion
          he was the guest of Herr, Dawson's re
          lief driver, who shares in tlte winning
          laurels.
          "Setting the world's record at an
          average of 78.7 miles per hour with a
          regulation stock car means something,"
          eaid Roberts yesterday, "especially as
          the car maintained that speed for six
          consecutive hours. It not pnly shows
          the strength and power of the motor,
          but the remarkable construction of the
          car, which at no time was forced to
          stop at the pit for mechanical adjust
          ments of any sort."
          Rene J. Marx, manager of the Sim
          plex-Mercer Pacific Coast agency was
          another of the joyous members of the

          cess of the Mercer car which finished
          third, covering the 500 miles in 6:34.56,
          an average of 78.07 miles an hour. The
          Mercer has never failed to come in the
          money in any event in which it ever

          a splendid showing in a competition I

          Racing is but part of the manufacturing
          process that tests and perfects National cars for
          your safety, comfort and indefatigable service.
          A race such as the 500-milc event, won by the
          National from a field of cars from all nations,
          most of which arc higher priccd than the Na
          tional, is a much harder test of every ounce of
          power and every fiber of strength than a tour of
          thousands of miles.
          That the National again proved its superi
          ority is your unimpeachable guide to the best car.
          regardless of cost. The race demonstrates the
          reliability, power and longevity of the National.

          ous business outlook is undoubtedly one
          reason why much interest is manifested
          by manufacturers who desire to further

          Mrs. Nicholas Longworth. daughter of

          making the trip in his S. G. V. car, and
          expects to return over the road about
          September 15.

          A 1912 flvp-passenger Paige taurine car
          was delivered last week to G. O. Wilson.
          The car is finished in dark blue, with gray
          running gear, and Is" fully equipped.

          To build, for the especial use of an
          automobile tour, a stretch of road over
          seventy miles in length, traversing a
          country that has heretofore been acces
          sible only to pack animals, is the unique
          feat of a body of public-spirited residents
          of northern Arizona.
          The new road connects the railroad of
          Ash Fork with the government reserva
          tion at Grand Canyon. The tour for
          which it was constructed Is the first of
          Its kind, including, as it does, an aggre
          gation of over sixty Studebaker cars,
          nearly all of which are owned in Phoenix,
          the Arizona metrppolis.
          When the tour was first announced it
          was the intent of the Phoenix men to
          drive their cars to the canyon by a rough
          roundabout route, following the lines of
          the Santa Fe railroad by way of Wil
          liams. Hut the citizens of Ash Fork ob
          jected. They readily appreciated the fact
          that their own town was missing a fine
          chance to show itself to advantage on
          the map. A committee accordingly told
          the Phoenix people that they would guar
          antee a more direct route via Ash Fork.
          Then they went to work with their picks
          and shovels, working out half-way, where
          they met a similarly public-spirited pang
          of road builders from Grand Canyon, who
          had laid out the second half of the trail.
          The whole Job was under the direction of
          the veteran "BH1" Bass, who has lived
          in the Grand Canyon country since be
          fore the days of the railroad, and lie
          has been locally credited on many occa
          sions with having dug the himself. This feat Mr. Bass modestly
          denies.
          The Studebaker Flanders "20." path
          finder tor the tour, recently made the
          trip to the canyon over the new road.
          Though the car carried tive men and
          their baggage, the run was easily made
          at an average speed of nearly twenty
          miles an hour.
          The entire distance over the new
          road longed slightly more than seven
          ty-three miles. About half was typical
          desert country, inhabited by prairie
          dog-s. coyotes, a few antelope and an
          immense herd of wild horses. The
          other half is similarly arid, but rather
          mountainous. For more than twenty
          five miles the road follows a tortuous
          valley. There is no human habita
          tion between Ash Fork and Grand
          Canyon, and not a single well or stream
          of water, except in the rainy season,
          now several months past.</text>

          Speedwpy Indianapolis, May 30. Five
          nations the United States, England,
          Prance, Germany and Italy today
          will fight for supremacy in the third
          an-.ual 500-mile automobile race to be
          held here. Everything at the speed
          way emphasizes the international
          phase of the contest. Flags of all na
          tions are flying from the grandstan-1
          and from the pits there arise a Jargon
          of many tongues.

          the roads were filled with automobiles
          by daylight. Hundreds of persons slept
          In the open Just outside the track, in
          order to be on hand when the gates
          opened at 6 o'clock. Inside Cap:ain

          stationed his men Just before the gates
          were opened ad gave them final in
          structions for handling the throng.
          Ambulances were placed about the
          track and everything prepared for the
          start at 10 o'clock sharp. Betting grew
          briser, with Burman still running the
          favorite by a slight margin over An- j
          derson. Stutz. Much money was placed
          on the foreign cars. The speed of the
          foreign cars seemed to give the bettors
          more confidence In them, although
          their ability to -withstand the terrific
          vibrative strain of the brick coursa -nd

          the emergency brakes.
          While going at high speed In the
          home stretch, the signal for the emer
          gency brakes was given and each car
          had to stop within a short distance.
          Other officials were busy at the pits
          checking up the driver, mechanicians
          and pit helpers as only a limited num
          ber were allowed in each pit.
          Race Starts.
          Promptly at 10 o'clock te 27 cars,
          led by Carl G. Fisher, millionaire
          sportsman, began the long race
          around the two and a half mile track,
          amid the cheers of thousands and
          the waving of flags of five nations.
          The cars got away with a flying start
          and were going 50 miles an hour as
          they came down the. long home
          stretch.
          Jenkins' Schact was the first car to
          stop at the pits. The machine blew
          a right rear tire. He lost a lap by
          the stop.
          Before Jenkins started again, An
          derson's Stutz drew up at the pits
          with the same trouble.
          Ralph De Palma, in a Mercer,
          dropped out of the race on the eigh
          teenth lap, on account of cylinder
          trouble. He was soon followed by
          Jenkins' Schacht, which broke a crank
          case in the twentieth lap.
          Kerr's Stutz broke a clutch re
          lease in the back stretch and caught
          fire. He was out of the race. No
          one was injured.
          The boiling hot sun caused consid
          erable tire trouble and one car after
          another dropped in at the pits for a
          change.

          Speedway, Indianapolis, May 30.
          Burman, in a Keeton,, leading for the
          first 100 miles, broke all speedway
          records for that distance. His time
          aws 1:15:50.55. The former record
          was 1:23:43.11.
          Goux, in the French Peugeot, was
          second. Twenty-three cars were still
          running at this distance.

          Zuearrelll's Peugeot, a French car,
          went out of race with burned out bear

          humiliation of seeing itself completely
          outgeneraled, thousands of lives and a

          depressing to its leaders. And it cost

          instances of conspicuous bravery, brav

          them during he long months of war
          that followed, and men in emergencies
          were strengthened to the same forti

          This was not done for reckless bra

          definite purpose of checking the panic.
          In this they failed, but they set an

          the Nation in later time.

          Spencer Wlshart, who drove a Mer
          cer car into second place at the finish
          of the race, was given a kissless and
          champagneles8 reception at the Mer
          cer pits, but his two hands, worn out
          by the steady work at the wheel of
          his car, were shaken wildly by a hun
          dred admirers. He was lifted upon
          the shoulders of his pit men and
          cheered with the enthusiasm equal to
          that accorded to the Frenchman. He
          was given a check for ?10,000.
          One of the most remarkable bits of
          race car driving was staged by
          Charles Merz In his Stutz car when
          he drove three and one-half miles,
          more than one lap around the course,
          with his car ablaze beneath the en

          hardly able to keep their seats on ac
          count of the flames that were licking
          at their legs. Merz was watched on
          his lap by the breathless thousands
          who feared his car would explode or
          that he would be driven from tho
          wheel by the ilameB. Displaying al
          most unbelievable nerve, he waved
          acknowledgement of the green flag,
          flashed over him by Starter Root as
          ho crossed the finish line for tho next

          Races With Car Ablaze.
          Spectators remaining in the grand
          stands and bleachers were on their
          feet straining for a glimpse of tho
          intrepid young Indianapolis driver as
          rounded the last curve and started
          down tho final Etrotch with tongues
          of flames spurting from under tho
          hood of his car. He could not havo
          mado another lap. His car would
          have gone to pieces in another mile.
          But it remained intact and continued
          to do his bidding until It limped
          across tho finish lino and Merz was
          $5,000 wealthier. Pit men had ex
          tinguishers ready and extinguished
          tho fire that soon would havo de
          Btroyed tho car. Charles Merz's fath

        <text>33 CARS FOR
          RJCFTKISyi
          W'HAT becomes of all the old
          automobiles?
          This is a question that has
          often been asked but seldom answered.
          Each year thousands of automobiles
          are manufactured and sold and thou
          sands are discarded to the scrapheap.
          Like all pieces of expensive machinery,
          the automobile winds up its career of
          usefulness by being sold for old Junk.
          Tho engines are often sold to second
          hand dealers, who utilize them for
          many different purposes.
          Many of tbe automobiles purchased
          years ago by El Pasoans-have long
          since found themselves in the discard,
          while others have burned, up. Perhaps
          the oldest car In point of service now
          owned In El Paso is a Rambler, pur
          chased in 1904 by Charles Rader. This
          car has traveled more than 100.000
          miles and Is today being used by Mr.
          Rader. The car is now nearly 15 years
          old and has seen hard service over the
          highways of the southwest

          Protect the Family
          In Bad Weather
          Everybody knows the Hupmobile has long been
          the car of the American family.
          Now it is the winter car of the American
          family, because the Sedan top gives the family com
          plete protection, says the Lone Star Motor Co., the
          local Hupmobile dealer.
          I'd like you to see the car with the top fitted, be
          cause I'm pretty sure you will want one for your own
          family.
          The extra cost is so small that it is out of all
          proportion to the comfort afforded and the colds and
          doctor bills it prevents. N
          Its appearance is handsome it harmonizes per
          fectly with the 1915 Hup's beautiful lines it is sub
          stantially built and firmly, though temporarily,
          attached.
          Inside it compares with the richest limousine.
          And when spring comes, take it off and store
          it away.
          If you care for your family's comfort and your
          own, better see the new car.

          Reo, which he purchased In 1907 and
          which has run approximately 75,000
          miles and is still In, use. This car has
          probably traveled further than any lit
          tle car ever owned In the southwest. It
          is still being used by Mr. Woodworth
          to drive daily to and from the office.
          Kl Paso's First Anto.
          The first automobile ever brought to
          El Paso was owned by the late Frank
          Bell, who brought it here in 1901. He
          purchased the car from the Locomobile
          factory and it was a great curiosity to
          the residents of El Paso. Every time
          Mr. Bell appeared on the streets with
          the machine a large crowd would
          gather to inspect the new form of lo
          comotion. The automobile was only in
          Its infancy when Mr. Bell purchased the
          car and he did not find it much of a
          pleasure conveyance. As a rule the ma
          chine was seldom taken from the
          garage without balking a short dis
          tance down the street The machine
          burned up in a fire about a year after
          Mr. Bell purchased it.
          The First Electric.
          The first electric automobile ever
          brought to El Paso was purchased by
          Felix Martinez. He states that he pur
          chased the car about 1899 to be used as
          a delivery car for the Daily News, since
          absorbed by The El Paso Herald. But,
          like the Locomobile owned by Mr. Bell,
          the electric was anything but a success
          as an automobile. Mr. Martinez, in
          speaking of the car recently, laughing,
          said that the machine only moved Tlen
          someone had his shoulder against it
          and seldom moied on its own locomo
          tion. After several experiments with
          the machine, he abandoned it, and
          finally gave it to some boys who soon
          destroyed it The electric cost Mr.
          Martinez $2700
          Roads Too Rough.
          J. A. Smith purchased one of the first
          gasoline automobiles in the city. It
          was a failure, principally because of
          the rough roads and streets at that
          time, and he finally sold it to a Mexi
          can and the car has long since been in
          the scrap heap.
          The car was a Cadillac and the ton
          noau opened in the back, the passen
          gers stepping up as in an omnibus. The
          seats were on either side and in the
          back corners
          There were many other automobiles
          purchased from that time until 1907,
          but there were few of the cars that
          were successes. In 1907 the state
          paBsed the automobile license law and
          all motorists In the county owning ma
          chines had to havo them registered.
          This is the first record obtainable of El
          Paso automobiles.
          The first automobile license Issued
          in 1907 by Park Pitman, county clerk,
          was taken out by Dr. Frank Thatcher.
          He secured the license on August 1, for
          a Holsman automobile, a small runa
          bout He still 1ms the car and drives
          it each day The machine has seen
          seven years of continual service.

          "Billy" Davis, a former railroad en
          gineer, on the 30th day of August 1914.
          took out the third automobile .license.
          This was his second car, however. His
          first one he purchased In 1902, when he
          gave up his position at the throttle of
          a locomotive and put the first public
          car into service in El Paso. Mr. Davis
          has been driving a public machine since
          that time. His first car was a Cadillac;
          his second an Oldsmoblle.
          The fourth automobile license Issued
          by the county clerk was taken out by
          W. B Latta for a Reo touring car. Mr.
          Latta states that he sold the machine
          a lear later, but docs not remember to
          whom.

          J. A. Krakauer took out the fifth au
          tomobile license, for a four cylinder
          Premier. He drove the car for several
          years and later tore it down The
          transmission is now being used to shift
          machinery in the shops of Krakauer,
          Zork Moye, sucrs. The frame of the

          Indianapolis, Ind., Dec 5. Entry
          lists for the next Indianapolis 500
          mlle race. May 29, are now open, S00
          entry blanks having been sent out to
          manufacturers of cars and private
          owners here and abroad. Despite the
          war. It is thought the contest will be
          most successful, plenty of material
          being available on both sides of the
          Atlantic Italy alone is expected to
          furnish no less than six machines.
          Changes in the specifications for the
          Indianapolis contest are numerous, the
          chief of these being the reduction of
          motor dimensions bv one-third, or from
          450 to 300 cubic inches, and the raising
          of the speed minimum to 80 miles.
          With much smaller machines better
          results are demanded. This Is the
          chief utilitarian function of the racing
          game.
          The number of starters has been
          raised to 23, as compared with 30 of
          ears previous. This Is the full ca
          pacity alloted the track under the rul
          ings of the American Automobile as
          sociation, which specify a limit of one
          car to everj 400 feet of track.
          Speed trials to determine the final
          field will be held 10 days ahead of
          the race, In the inverse order of en
          try, the fastest 33 being eligible. In
          the event of more than three cars of
          one "make entering, the fastest three
          will be admitted. This Is to eliminate
          the speedway from wrangles between
          factories and private owners desiring
          to enter cars of the same make In ex
          cess of the A. A. maximum.
          Cars will line up for the start In the
          order of the time made in the speed
          trials, the fastest car starting in first
          position, next the pole. Racing num
          bers will be issued on the same plan,
          the fastest car receiving No. 1. This
          is to avoid the possibility of a spill
          during the flying start, when a slow
          machine in front would be in the why.
          The color of cars will be according
          to international usage, i. e, Germany,
          white; Belgium, yellow; France, blue;
          Italy, red, and America, red and white.
          In previous years Individual combina
          tions have been employed, at times to
          the great amusement of the spectators.
          Regulations as to the physical con
          dition of drivers and the mechanical
          soundness of cars will be more rigid
          ly enforced next year than ever be
          fore The front axles of all machines
          must thus be entirely new two days
          before the race This is to guard
          against possibility of accident, due to
          crystallization or other defect Any
          car spilling an excess of oil on the
          track, will, for like reasons, be dis
          qualified. The Dawson-Gilhooley accident of
          last year has caused chain-driven cars
          to be barred from the track, Unless
          the chains are adequately though not
          necessarily fully enclosed. Gllhooley,
          it will be remembered, came to grief
          because a bursted tire caught between
          his chain and gears, rendering his car
          beyond control, due to the action of
          his differential. This accident was not
          as has so often been stated, traceable
          to incompetence on Gilhooley's part
          Prizes remain substantially ths
          same, $60,000 being split 10 ways
          among the winners, with $20,000 first
          money.- The intermediate trophies,
          however, including the G. J. trophy,
          the Remy trophy and brassard, the
          Prest-O-Lite trophy, and the AVheeler
          Schebler cup, will not be withRVld If
          their winner falls to go the entire dis
          tance of 500 miles, as formerly, but it
          will be awarded regardless of their
          owner's status at the finish. This, It
          is thought, will speed up the race a
          great deal.</text>

        <text>NEARLY KILLED MANY TIMES OVER, AUTO
          RACERS WILL AGAIN DEFY DEATH MONDAY
          Once an auto racer, always in
          auto racer. There is something
          In that game of whizz and thrill
          that causes meu to forget; to
          Ignore all past injuries; and to
          risk, their lives again and again.
          When the big squad of the
          fastest drivers ln the world gets
          the word to go Monday at Indian
          apolis at least 20 men who have
          escaped death narrowly, who
          have been broken and torn, who
          have been hurled through the Ur,
          who have fried under burning,
          overturned wreckage of great
          racing machines, will shoot away
          from the mark.
          In the van will be Joe Dawson
          who, a year ago on that same
          track was hurled through the
          barriers, burned under the wreck
          age of his burning car and
          dragged out cut and torn beyond
          recognition.
          They are strange beings, these
          fellows who risk limb and m-yi
          for money and sport.
          Ralph De Palma, now premier
          driver of the world, has been
          known at once as the luckiest
          and unluckiest driver. His worst
          accident wan the crash at Mil
          waukee in 1912, when near the
          finish he had a mixup with Caleb
          Bragg that spoiled one of the
          greatest finishes of auto racing.
          Bragg is a man worth perhaps
          $5,000,000 who races for the
          thrills. He is ln this race.
          Even recent accidents seem to
          have little effect. Tom Alley
          went through a fence; Ed O'Don
          nell crashed into the fence and
          was turned over; Ed Pullen, who
          was badly hurt a year ago, mixed
          In another accident ln the Van
          derbilt this year aud escaped with
          slight injuries—and all are back
          to risk more of the same as smil
          ing and fearless as If nothing
          ever went wrong.
          John De Palatna has had a
          dozen bad spills, even though
          this is his first really big race.
          He is a brother qL the faniojs
          Ralph and the majority of his ac
          cidents have happened on the
          small "bush" tracks.
          Dario Resta, the wild man, had
          a terrible accident at Brook fields.
          was in a had smashup at Berlin
          and a worse one at Rome, but
          drives as if he never knew a car
          could turn ovtrr.
          Bob f_iir.ii.-iti has faced death
          many times. Perhaps his narrow
          est escape was in 1912 when "its
          car blew out both roar tires at
          the same instant. The machine
          was hurled into the air, turned
          three somersaults, and alighted a
          smoking mass of twisted steel—•
          with Burnian underneath and .ie
          crawled out without dangerous
          Injuries.
          Yes, they are all back. So lo.igl
          as they have a leg or an arm
          they'll be there.

          19, the contestants sprinted bark
          and forth across the big' Olympic
          club tank an hour each day.
          Smith established 62 miles aa ills
          record for the 30 hours' swim

          has also come from the Public

          the United States Auto Club.
          Though Cheesbourg has been
          plagued with bad luck at the
          Indianapolis Speedway, he has
          established himself as one of
          the nation's leading stock car
          drivers and in 1955 captured Ari
          zona's Triple Crown of Racing,
          the midget, sprint and roadster
          championships. He is also a
          member of the world's most ex
          clusive club, the Champion 100
          Mile-An-Hour Club, reserved for
          those drivers who complete the
          500 miles without relief at an
          average speed of more than 1001
          miles an hour.
          He is one of eight Tndianapo

        <text>Babe Ruth Is Lucky to Get Off So Easily After Hittimj Umpire
          FAR be It from ua to wish any guy haid luck, but It appears that Babo Ruth
          escftpefl too easily after his fight with Umplro Owens on tho ball field. Ban
          Johnson dismissed the matter with a flno of $100 nnd a suspension of ono week.
          This does not seem enough, nnd It Is certain that a player of less lmportanro
          would have been treated rather harshly. Ruth is one of tho stars of tho lcaguo .
          and a prolonged nbsenco would havo ruined Boston's pennant chances. Also tho
          gate receipts would have suffered. So Bnttllns Ban beenme as meek ns a lamb
          and decided to "give the boy another chance."
          The bad feature of this case Is that It will cnconrago others to pull tho same
          Btuff. A week's layoff nnd $100 fine Is nice, gentle punishment, nnd tho chances
          are that some playora would pay twice as much for a shot at nn umpire's Jaw.
          It cost McGraw $500 for punching Byron under tho grnnd stand nnd Ruth'a of
          fense was more flagrant thnn that. Ban seems to havo mado another mistake.
          Ho should, have used Ruth ns a horrlblo example and soaked him with a long
          layoff and a healthy tine.
          The dope has run to form at Pittsburgh. Barney Dreyfuss showed Jimmy
          Callahan the way to the gate nnd ho departed from tho city of smoke amid the
          crash and clatter of tho tlnwnro which was dragging behind. Callahan barf not
          made good with the Pirates nnd last year thero was talk of canning him. Ho
          is not popular with the players nnd they wouldn't work for him. Thls also was
          the case when Jimmy was boss of the Whlto Sox. His ability was great, but his
          personality negative.</text>

        <text>Ruth Pitches Red Sox to 1 to O Victory in First World Series Game
          Facts and Fancies
          ^^_By LOUIS LEE ARMS-_
          "Stuffy" Busted In .
          EARL HAMILTON, the left-hander who won six consecutive
          pames for the Pittsburgh Pirates this spring, and then en?
          listed in the United States Navy, used to Bay of "Stuffy"
          Mclnnis, then first baseman of the Philadelphia Athletics:
          "If a left-hander should place a baseball in a burglar-proof box
          and try to sneak it across the plate in the middle of the night he'd
          find 'Stuffy* Mclnnis there waiting to hit. There's one bird who lives
          in luxury off left-handers. He can hit anything they pitch."
          We observe that "Stuffy" broke it up yesterday.
          Vaughn passed Shean, Whiteman blew himself to a single and
          then Mclnnis. catching one of "Hippo" Vaughn's southpaw shoots,
          firmly laced it to left field for the single that scored Shean and gave
          the Red Sox the first game.
          It appears that this Beries is going to run to form.
          Victory Was Merited
          'fHE Cubs should have won, you say, but shoul dthey? In the first,
          1 third, and sixth innings they had men In scoring positions. A single
          would have scored two runs and beat the Sox in two of these innings;
          in the other the score would have been tied. But Pick, Paskert and
          Deal couldn't deliver the essential wallop when the time came. Base?
          ball is, more than anything else, a matter of doing the right thing at
          the right time. Mclnnis did that Pick, Paskert and Deal didn't.
          Ruth in the supreme test surpassed Vaughn, even though the pitching
          figures would indicate that Vaughn had the better of an exceedingly
          interesting duel. The assertion that Chicago should have won merits
          specific qualification.
          Ruth Is Boston's Ace
          THE Red Sox, always a "money team," are legitimately jubilant.
          At worst they will come back to Boston with one victory and two
          defeats. More of such excellent pitching and they will do better.
          Should they win two games and lose but one in Chicago they will be
          the long enders in whatever betting is done after the third game.
          But the jig isn't up with Chicago. Far from it. Vaughn meas?
          ured up to expectations and proved that the Sox do not relish first
          class southpaw pitching. Mitchell has Tyler in reserve and he can
          shoot Vaughn back in the third game if necessary. It remains to be
          seen if Bush or Mays, right-handers, can do as well against the. Cubs
          as Ruth did. Ruth is a great personality on a ball field. A giant in
          stature, resolute of purpose and with a wonderful "single-track"
          brain, re represents almost the ideal athlete for competitive effort
          under groat -Tain. Bush and Mays are not Ruth's equals in tem?
          perament. ,
          Fielding Rather a Surprise I
          THE fielding was a surprise. There were no errors, but neither
          were there hard chances. Chicago hit the ball into the air in the
          pinches and it is a bit early for any one to pull a Snodgrass. The
          Cubs' steck might have soared had the ball been hit on the ground
          and at one of Boston's "green" infielders. Likewise the Cubs ac?
          quitted themselves with honor in the field, but few of their plays,
          too, were made under strain.
          It is an old superstition that the team which wins the first game
          takes the series in this play. But it doesn't follow that there can't
          be exceptions to what has iUogically come to be regarded as a rule.
          The Sox met the rest best yesterday, but more of the Vaughn type
          of pitching and the Curs cannot fail to come through.

        <text>LOOKING EM OVER
          BY
          LOUIS A. DOUGHER
          Georsre Herman Ruth, better known as Battering Babe Ruth, prin
          ipai slugger in major league baseball these day?, has recently given
          ha world an insight into his peculiar brain procesa?if you will admit
          e possesses a brain. Incidentally, hie speech shows him to be quite in
          ccord with many others who think little of their plighted faith. Though
          ;? has two more years to complet? his contract ?with the Boston Red
          ex at a salary of $10,000 yearly. Ruth would sign a new one calling
          ?7T $20,000 yearly. Furthermore, he says he will not play with the Boe
          ra club unless his wishes are granted.
          . Last spring Ruth held out until the last minute. He wanted a
          alary of $15,000, if our memory be correct, but finally compromised by
          ?ft?ing a three-year-contract calling for a salary of $10,000 yearly. All
          oat took place before he began hammering home runs until he had
          Token ail previous big league records for this stunt. He admitted that
          e was satisfied with the treatment given him by both Harry Frazee and
          Jd Barrow. He proved it by playing fine ball all season. But Babe has
          '?gtened to -erpent tongues. Now he would quit playing ball unless the
          ?oston club agrees to make a new contract calling for $20,000 a year.
          The Joke of the sltuatioa is that
          tarry Frasee la In pretty much of a
          " ? He has established a precedent
          W Ruth to follow by trading Carl
          is;, s to the New Tork club when the
          ubmarine funger grew tired of
          iking along with a losing club. So
          ar as Frasee ia concerned, he has
          ittlc argument to offer Ruth when
          'Bey ?ret together for a conference
          ?garehng this contract matter But
          ni? doesn't absolve Ruth, just the
          ?am?

          ftsrure. I shall refuse to play ball and
          'he Boston club will have to sell my
          rei aase
          "Mays had a contract for three
          rears, but he made the Boston club
          *ei: him to the Yankees. Be Just
          luit the Red Sox and went home. If
          stave can get away with that kind of
          ?tuff you bet I can do the same.

          ??Bring but my contract contains the
          ten days' release clause, which makes
          ?t Illegal. If I lost an arm or a leg.
          'hey could let me go and I couldn't
          ?ret the rest of this salary.
          "I'm the best drawing card in the
          mtne no? Ty Cobb's salary is
          *r20 000 ? y??ar and I intend to net the
          ?ame money. You can say for me
          hat I shall not put on a Boston uni
          form next year if I don't receive just
          JO ?WO Iron ma."
          This must be great reading for
          those misguided fools in Boston who
          presented Battering Babe with a $500
          diamoci at the close of the season
          a? an appreciation of his great work
          for the city. Some day the fans will
          a-et the rieht angle on what profes
          sional ball players think of them.
          Then they'll cot out all those foolish
          pr?seentations of traveling bags, suits
          of clothes and diamond stick pins.
          not to speak of watches and charms.
          The players take them-?sure, why

          oaughed up their coin for the present.

          Manhattan Tribe Purchase Home Run Slug
          ger From Hub City Team in Biggest Deal
          In History of Baseball.
          Boston, Jan. 5.?"Babe" Ruth, world champion home-run player
          of the Red Sox, has been bought by the New York Yankees, ac
          cording to an announcement made tonight. Harry H. Frazee, owner
          of the Red Sox, who told of the sale of Ruth, declined to name the
          price paid, but declared it was larger than had ever before been paid.
          The deal was said to have involved no other players.
          Estimates, unofficial, but said to have been based upon "inside
          information," placed the figure at which "Babe" Ruth was told at
          ,the unprecedented sum of $125,000. Efforts to have this estimate
          substantiated or denied failed, but it was generally reported that the
          figure was not far from correct.
          Highest Figure Yet Paid.
          If the estimate proves accurate, the sale of Ruth not only ele
          vates the trading of baseball players to inclusion in the category of
          sugar, shoes, clothing and other high-priced necessities, but records
          a sale at more than double the highest price heretofore paid for
          a player.
          When Alexander and Killifer were traded from Philadelphia to
          Chicago, $55,000 changed hands. The greatest price paid for a single
          player up to the trading of Ruth was said to have been the $50,000
          given for Tris Speaker when he went from the Red Sox to Cleveland.

          The Wc!l-Knnivn Phyticitt.
          AST Mason "I' .abe" Ruth broke all
          baseball records by hitting twenty*
          nine homo runs. Ar.l this season
          there is every indication that ho will beat
          his 11*10 total by a wide margin.
          What is tho se ret of Ruth's ability to
          make home runs with such surprising fre
          quency? ?; it because he Is possessed of greater strength than his fellow players?
          Is it because his vision is keener or his museles better ca-ordinated? All these tilings
          doubtless have some thing to lo with it, but the real reason for thl:- iii.yionn'nal
          series of home runs sci i nee finds to be the way Xvitlx applies to his work with the bat
          certain well-known principles of physics and psychology. "But." you say. "Iluth Is a ball
          plavor. What does ho know of physics or psy chology?" Notheing, perhaps, but whether con
          sciou.ly or unconsciously Ruth applies certain well-known principles of these two sciences
          every time ho makes a homo run. Let us consider some of the many inter rsting scientific
          factors involved in bat t itig a ball. As very follower of baseball knows, a home run is
          the knocking of the ball out of the reaoli of opposing players and in .r.uch a direction
          and to nuch a distance as o make its return impossil'o before th? runner completes the
          circuit of the bases. Viewed as n mechanical proolem. the hit ting of a home run moans
          simply hitting t)i ball with the bat so as to give it great
          speed in the proper direction. The spe^l
          and direction which the bat can To made to
          give tilt; ball depend on the degree of tin
          curve which tlio pitcher has imparted to
          the ball, the weight of the ball, the. weight
          of the bat, the elasticity of the ball and
          bat. and the angle at which tin, ball iir
          pinges on the bat.
          The speed which a ball t * es on im
          mediately after its collision w'th the bat
          is a little difficult to compete because
          neither the bat nor the ball is perfectly
          elastic or perfectly non-elaaMc. To illus
          trate tlio difficulty of such a o mputation
          let mo explain what happens when per
          fectly elastic and perfectly non-elastic
          bodies come into collision.
          If two inelastic bodies?say two pieces
          of lead?of equal weight and going with
          equal speed, but in opposite directions
          meet squarely "in mid-air, they will both
          stop and fall to the ground, all theii
          energy of motion having been turned into
          heat. If, however, perfectly elastic bodler
          of the same weight going with the same
          velocity, but in opposite directions, mee?
          in mid-air, they will bounce back with
          the same velocity they had originally. 11
          one of these bodies has twice the velocity
          of the other, the latter will bounce back
          with twice its original velocity and tho
          former will bounce back only half as fast.
          All this applies to bodies having tho same
          weight. Whenever one of the colliding
          bodies is heavier than- the other, the ve
          locity given tho latter body upon bouncing
          is enormously increased.
          The bat which "Rabe" Ruth wields and
          the ball which he hits are both fairly clas
          tic; therefore, everything else being equal,
          the ball will be driven farther the heavier
          the bat and the faster the bat is moving
          as it hits the ball. Also, as tho weight of
          "Halm" Ruth' s body prevents his bat from
          doing much bouncing back, tho faster the
          ball corner, the farther It will go when ho
          hits it.
          The weight of tho ball Itself is a very
          important factor in hitting a homo run,
          viewed us a scientific problem. If thero

          were no atmosphere, everytliine be
          ing equal, the lighter tne Dall happened to
          ho the farther it would go. The friction of
          the air. however, slows the ball up con
          siderably, and this fact has to bo taken
          into consideration with several others.
          The conclusion which science reaches Is
          that the heavier tho ball is, without In
          creasing its size or decreasing Its elas
          ticity, tho farther it will go after being
          struck with tho bat.
          The direction taken by a batted ball is
          affected to some extent by the rotation of
          tho ball as it strikes the bat. Thi3 factor
          is of the neatest importance when the
          but does not strike tho ball squarely.
          It is possible for the hat to hit the ball
          in such a way that it actually increases the
          latter's rotation. In other words, it is per
          fectly possible for the batter to hit tho
          ball in such a way that it takes on a de
          cided curve. Everybody who plays golf
          knows what a common occurrence this is
          on the links. A golf hall when struck acci
          dentally oft' centre will ofton describe the
          weirdest imaginable path through the air,
          particularly if it passes through various
          air currents.
          A honr n depends to a very large ex
          tent up ? direction given the batted
          ball. T ' ortanco of this factor 'may
          he estimated a- nine times that of tho
          speed given the hat*~d ball. 13y direction
          we mean not only the horizontal angle, but
          also the vertical angle at which tho ball
          leaves the hat. For example, no matter
          how hard the ball is hit, it will never re
          sult in a home run unit's ."t clears the
          upstretched arms of the p1 ?yers in tho
          field.
          It is plain that the direction given
          the butted ball must depend to a largo
          extent upon the manner in which the ball
          is travelling before it meets tho bat. Pro
          vided the ball is given a proper rota
          tion on its horizontal axis by the pitcher,
          the kind of curve best suited to make it
          difficult to hit it at the proper vertical
          angle is either tho down shoot or the up
          shoot. On account of the many variablo
          factors concerned science believes that any
          home run made with either of theso curve3
          is a lucky chance pure and simple.
          After the ball has boon set in motion by
          the bat with a certain speed, tho distance
          it will go depends upon the vertical angle
          at which it starts. The most desirable
          angle i3 one of 12 degrees with the ground,
          or about half a right angle. Other factors
          which determine the distance a batted ball
          will travel are the speed of the ball, its
          sphericity, the smoothness of its surface
          and its lack of rotation. Tho greater tho
          speed of the ball tho more perfectly
          spherical it is. tho smoother its surface
          and the less rotation with which it travels
          the farther it will go. Atmospheric con
          ditions, of course, enter into tho problem.
          A ball will go farther in a clear air that is
          free from moisture. Tho wind may carry
          it bodily for quite a distance or may retard
          its progress.
          If science wore asked to make it difficult
          or well-nigh impossible for "Babe" Kutli to
          Ltit a home run it would select a day w.ien
          tho barometer was high, with the air so
          heavy with moisture that it would retard
          the progress of tho batted ball. Iho
          pitcher selected would be one good on very
          alow but curvy downshootfl. If such a
          pitcher were not available, one who hid
          euch great speed that lie couid put any
          kind of a ball over the plato for tho
          batter would bo chosen. With this
          hind of a pitcher the ball is likely to
          be hit behind the plate and unlikely to bo
          started on its course at the proper angle.
          His hitting of a homo run could then bo
          mado stHI more difficult by compelling the
          redoubtable "Babe" to use a bat either so
          heavy that he could not swing it with much
          speed, or so light that it would tend to hit
          tho ball at tho wrong horizontal angle.
          There is a certain spot on the bat, usu
          ally a few inches from tho end. but vary
          ing with dlfVerent bats, which science
          knows as the centre of percussion. If the
          ball hits the bat exactly on this spot tho
          greatest effect is produced. All ball play
          ers are aware when the ball hits this spot
          on the bat, not only through the absence
          of jar to the arm, but also through a pecul
          iar satisfaction which is hard to define,
          but which is no doubt physical as well as
          mentnl.
          "Babe" Ruth's phenomenal home run rec
          ord is largely due to tho fact that, con
          sciously or unconsciously, he has found a
          way of producing the collision between
          his bat and tho ball on this centre of per
          cussion more frequently than any other
          player.
          What is called the centre of percussion
          is a principle that enters into the design
          not only ot baseball bats, but of all things
          designed for men to swing. In the ham
          mer, for example, the centre of percussion
          should be in the head. If the tool is not
          designed so that this centre is properly
          located the hammer is unsatisfactory to
          use because it jars and tires tho am too
          much.
          The problem of hitting homo runs with
          the surprising frequency that "Babe" Ruth
          does is ono more complicated in the mat
          ter of powers of Judgment and observa
          tion involved than in mechanical prin
          ciples. Viewed as a mechanical problem,
          tho home run requires a bat just as heavy
          as a player can use with comfort, tho bat
          to bo given a motion as fast as possible
          when hitting the ball, and striking the
          ball so that it wilt ho impelled into tho
          air at an anglo of approximately 42 de
          grees or half a right angle. The ball
          should also, of course, be hit at such a
          horizontal angle as not to cause a foul.
          T^lio weight of the batter has very little
          to do with tho matter of home runs, hut his
          arm muscles are a controlling factor to
          the extent of, say, fifty per cent. Of course,
          If his arms are rigid enough to make tho
          bat for all practical purposes a part of his
          body when he hits the ball, and if his body
          is swung forward at just that instant, it
          Is possible that a heavy batter, all other
          things being equal, would be able to knock
          the ball farther than a lighter player.

          To follow tho ball as it leaves the pitcher's
          hand is no easy matter, as tho sphere is
          often travelling at the rate of lf0 feet
          a second, or nearly two milos a minuto.
          The eye movement necessary to follow it
          increases greatly as tho ball draws nearor
          and nearer the plato, owing to tho in
          crease in the angle of vision which, by the
          time the ball is over tho plate, is about
          ten times what it was when it left tho
          pitcher's hand.
          As 1 have said, tho pitcher often hurls
          the ball at the rato of 150 feet a second.
          But tho ball is travelling much faster
          than that when it leaves "Babe" Ruth's bat
          after being hit for one of tho home runs
          that have made him famous. This is in
          accordance with the laws of tho impact of
          clastic bodies.

          Of courso, If it Is raining
          when one of "Babe" Ruth's
          long hits is made, the
          drops of water striking tho
          ball will bring it to the
          ground long before it
          otherwise would fall. Tho
          rain also makes the ball
          heavier, and as It contains
          only so much energy to

          on.., wo find, by applying a well known
          formula of physics, that 1,200 foot pounds
          of actual energy or work is done. Now,
          if it takes Ruth one-twentieth of a second
          to impart this energy by a swing of his bat,
          this would be at tho rate of 24,000 foot
          pounds a second, which is about forty-four
          horsepower.

          Of course, there are many psychological
          as well as mechanical factors involved in
          the hitting of tho long scries of home runs
          which "Babe" Ruth has been making for
          two seasons. The batter must bo able to
          "sense" in some manner not yet fully un
          derstood just about what kind of ball the
          pitcher is going to throw. Then he must bo
          capable of putting his body in readiness
          with lightning swiftness to meet that kind
          of ball when it passes over the plate. Tho
          player's Judgment about tho bull must bo
          made within tho smallest fraction of a sec
          ond after it leaves tho pitchpr's hand.
          Through some queer sixth sense?tne
          kinaesthotic sense, as psychologists call it
          ?all batters have tho feeling as to whether
          the trnll tho pitcher is about to throw is go
          ing to pass over the plato or not. In tho
          average batter the impressions conveyed
          by this sixth sense caunot be more than 50
          per cent accurate, but in the case of "Babe"
          Ruth, as his batting record shows, they
          must be about 90 per cent accurate. As
          everybody who plays baseball or ever
          watches a game knows, you can't strike out
          and make a homo run. and the player can
          seldom hit a home run unless the bail ha
          strikes is taking a course that would havo
          carried it straight across the plate unless
          Interrupted by his bat.
          This, then, is the secret of "Babe"
          Ruth's home runs as viewed from a scien
          tist: standpoint. A highly developed kin
          aesthetic sense enables him to "sense" the
          kind of ball the pitcher is going to throw.
          When a ball rotating on Its horizontal
          n.\is and curving most favorably for his
          purpose comes along he swings his bat at
          it with an energy sufficient to chango its
          direction and greatly increase its velocity.
          The bat Is swung in such a way that the
          centre of percussion meets the ball, send
          ing it upward at an angle of 42 degrees
          and not too far to the right or the left.
          When all these things happen the result
          should bo a home run, provided that the
          pitcher has given the ball proper speed
          and that tho wind and other atmospheric
          conditions aro favorable.</text>

          Great American Question 4
          By W? O. McGeehan
          IF THE lata lamented Shakes?
          peare were a' baseball writer he
          might usa a line that he
          wested upon some more or less
          obscure hero of antiquity and say of
          "Babe" Ruth, "He doth bestride the
          narrow baseball fields like a Colos?
          sus." For "Babe" Ruth is Hercules
          and Thor reincarnated, the Colossus
          of Swat. His bat is the club of
          Hercules and the hammer of Thor,
          the symbol of sheer, primitive might
          before which the puny folk bow and
          offer worship.
          But for the game of baseball, the
          youngest game of the youngest peo?
          ple, George Herman Ruth, the
          "Babe" Ruth who dwarfs all other
          personalities in the daily news,
          might have been a peaceful cigar
          maker or perhaps a third-rate
          heavyweight pugilist instead of the
          national idol of the American people.
          The "Babe" was Fortune's dar?
          ling, though Fortune concealed her
          great and kindly intentions as far as
          he was concerned when the "Babe"
          was 2. boy. For the "Babe" was
          born left-hander!. Hercules was a
          right-hander. Thor never was pic?
          tured as wielding his hammer from
          the port side. None of the heroes of
          antiquity, as far as can be ascer?
          tained, was a southpaw. Harry Leon
          Wilson was the first novelist to put a
          left-hander in the near-hero class,
          and he i ;d it in a half-hearted
          fashion.
          Moreover, little George Herman
          Ruth was a half-orphan at a very
          early age and was sent to an insti?
          tution for orphans. He was nearly
          an orphan boy, and, according to
          the San ford and Merton books, he
          should have taken a morbid sort of
          point of view at an early age and
          learned something useful. But the
          youth of "Babe" Ruth was applied
          mostly to the study of the great
          American game of baseball.
          You are not going to draw any
          conventional moral from the early
          boyhood of "Babe" Ruth. He was
          not a particularly industrious or
          thrifty lad, chockful of conventional

          chuckle-headed combination of Tom
          Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn. He
          Was Just natural and just human.
          FORTUNATELY the boyhood of
          "Babe" Ruth was intrusted to
          men who understand human
          nature, and particularly the human
          boy?the Christian Brothers, of Bal?
          timore. The fraternity is not limited
          to Baltimore. It is all over the
          *orld. It is made up of big-hearted
          ?fcn. consecrated to the work of mak
          lfig men out of the raw material.
          They had charge of the bringing
          UP of George Herman Ruth and
          'hey have turned over to the world
          ??Colossus of Swat. It is due to
          th*ir human understanding that
          George Herman Ruth was not

          ; is the rise of "Babe" Ruth. The Al-,
          | ger heroes became mere bankers or
          traction magnates, but George Her
          | man Ruth, the waif of Baltimore, be?
          came "Babe" Ruth, at whose shrine
          ' bankers and traction magnates burn
          incense. Ever and anon these jaded
          near-successes pick up the tape, not
          to see the condition of the market,
          but to learn whether the latest is the
          forty-fifth or forty-sixth home run
          ! knocked out by the "Babe" for the
          I season.
          And these heroes envy "Babe"
          ! Ruth the left-handed, the boy who
          ! was regarded as far from bright in
          ;his classes. For the "Babe" can hit
          them out with the joyous freedom of
          Hei-culcs swinging his club or Thor
          throwing his hammer through the'
          clouds. All the tricks of the pitchers
          are vain when he faces them, and all
          the walls of the baseball parks are
          lowered when his bat crashes against
          the baseball. Homer would have
          loved him if the blind singer had had
          a season pass to the Polo Grounds.
          THAT Ruth is the greatest bat?
          ter of them all is admitted by
          two members of the old Orioles;
          and when two members of the old
          Orioles agree upon anything, that
          makes it official and irrefutable. If
          there is anybody so ignorant of im?
          portant American history that he
          does not know who the old Orioles
          are, we will explain, more in pity
          than in indignation, that the old
          Orioles were members of the great?
          est baseball team of a generation or
          so ago.
          The two Orioles who made the ad?
          mission that "Babe" Ruth was the
          greatest baseball player in the whole
          world are Wilbert Robinson, mana?
          ger of the Brooklyn National League
          baseball team, and Joseph Kelly,
          scout for the Yankees. Both of these
          gentlemen are grandfathers and citi?
          zens of high repute in the city where
          they dwell, which also happens to i
          be the home of "Babe" Ruth. "Wil-1
          bert Robinson was a catcher, and still
          ; holds the world's record for consecu?
          tive base hits in one game. Joseph
          Kelly was an outfielder of sorts on
          the old Orioles, and his present oc-1
          cupation is "ivory hunting," looking
          upon baseball playera and appraising
          them ?at their true  jrtb to their
          employers and to the national pas?
          time.
          These two authorities admitted" to
          me in th? presence of witnesses that
          never, even in the days of the old
          Orioles, was there a baseball player
          who could hit like "Babe" Ruth. Con?
          sider the importance of this admis?
          sion. The members of the old Ori?
          oles are the most conservative per?
          sons in th vorld. Never before
          have they au. : ..ed that any player
          of the present was anywhere near as
          wonderful as tl\e players of their
          glorious day.
          "He can hit them harder than any?
          body, and he can hit them oftener,"
          they admitted from the fullness of
          their hearts. They did not qualify
          the statement, They did ?ob assert
          that the pitchers were less canny
          and that the ball parks were smaller.
          They admitted that the heroes of
          their day were lost in the shadow of
          the Colossus of Swat. They admitted
          that even in the days when the old
          Orioles were young "Babe" Ruth
          would have loomed up above them
          all.
          That Ruth broke all big league
          records for home run getting last
          year is in the book. That he has
          broken his own record this year and
          is on the way to setting a mark far
          beyond the misty horizons ?if the
          baseball world is l?o\vn. But the
          old Orioles have explained away the
          performances of other more modern
          heroes of baseball. Ruth's achieve?
          ments they Jrott ungrudgingly.,
          That is almost as marvelous as the
          achievements themselves.
          .
          ONCE upon a time the youth of
          this land worshiped another
          young giant, a right-hander
          and an exponent of another and el?
          der sport?John L. Sullivan. The
          right arm of John L. ?Sullivan was
          mighty in its day, but the left arm i
          of "Babe" Ruth is mightier in its I
          day and generation in the matter of
          sheer numbers of worshipers.
          | They used to block the corridors
          of the hotels, and even the streets,1
          ? to see the mighty John L. pass. They
          do that in the case of "Babe" Ruth,
          I too. It is not for me to disparage
          | the memory of John L. Sullivan, the
          | gladiator, in th? days-cf hi? greatest
          -?
          ring glory, but I think, that his ad?
          mirers saw that particular John L.
          through rose glasses and that they
          worshiped an illusion.
          The John L. Sullivan of the later !
          day, the John L. who beat down his ?
          own worst enemy and lifted up his ;
          self-respect from the muck, was the
          John L. that should have been wor- ;
          shiped, for that John L. Sullivan :
          was a mighty gladiator. The John ,
          L. Sullivan who knocked out ring an- j
          tagonists with a right-hand punch to j
          the jaw was a mere mass of brawn ?
          and muscle, but the gray and fat old |
          John L. who conquered himself was i
          the true fighter.
          But we are considering the John L.
          that was the popular idol, the '
          brawny man who was followed by '
          the men and the boys and cheered
          when he stalked abroad. He was !
          not a particularly affable character.
          This big "Babe" Ruth is a far
          more likable person. He is full of i
          good nature and the joy of living.
          He is a modest enough young man, :
          and he knows his limitations, though ;
          he acknowledges no limitations as j
          far as the baseball diamonds and j
          the fences around them are con
          cerned. He is not falsely modest to
          the point of affectation, for he has
          that supreme confidence in himself
          that comes after certain achievement.
          But he will not play to the gallery
          consciously. He likes the gallery
          and he understands it, and he likes
          to have it understand him. ?
          Ruth is, perhaps, too simple, or
          it may be too wise, to try to fool his
          gallery, as other stars of his own ;
          game or stars in other lines of en?
          deavor have tried to do in vain. For
          nobody can fool his gallery. No
          truly wise man ever tried.
          THE best judges of a man ar?
          the men with whom he works !
          or with whom he plays.
          "Babe" Ruth, naturally, is the high?
          est salaried ballplayer on the New
          York Yankees. He might, if he were
          like some of the stars of baseball or i
          stars of some of the arts, claim all
          the privileges of a star and hold
          himself aloof from his fellow players.
          Here again is the simplicity or the
          wisdom of "Babe" Ruth. He plays
          the game with the team and for the
          team, and the men ' he plays with
          know it and appreciate it. "Babe'
          Ruth will even make the "college
          try" to get a base on an impossible
          chance. The "cdllege try" is the vet?
          eran professional's term of contempt
          for zealous endeavor that seems fu?
          tile on the facts of it.
          _ an the "Babe" *nake?th? two
          owners of the Yankees, Colonels I
          Ruppert and Huston, shudder with !
          apprehension when he hurls himself
          against a wall to get a fly ball, or I
          when he throws his huge bulk
          through the air in the effort to steal i
          a base. They rejoice in his spirit
          and his wholehearted way of play?
          ing, but at the same time they per?
          spire with apprehension lest some?
          thing should happen that would de?
          prive them of the most expensive in?
          vestment in professional baseball.
          Some stars have disrupted base?
          ball teams, rousing jealousies, but
          "Babe" Ruth, admittedly the great?
          est star of them all, has made the
          Yankees a team. The advent of the
          "Babe" has brought them the chance
          of that "world's scries dough," which
          should be something like $7,000 a
          player. It has also made them the
          team of the big leagues. They do not
          begrudge the "Babe" the homage
          that is paid him. As far as Ruth
          is concerned, there is no professional
          jealousy on the Yankee team.
          Just to what extent the present
          prosperity of professional baseball
          is due to "Babe" Ruth I would not
          care to say, but it is considerable
          When I first trailed West with tht
          Yankees, they told me in Chicagc
          that there had been little or no in
          tereat in the Chicago White Sox. Bu
          I when the Yankees came ta Cbicagi
          they turned out to the extent of 20,
          000 a day and upward to see the
          "Babe" "bust one."
          Once, with the score 2 to 1 in the
          eighth and a tense pitchers' duelen,
          the Chicago pitcher passed "Babe"
          Ruth. Ten thousand people started
          to walk out of Comiskey Park.
          There remained yet the chance of
          the melodramatic ninth inning rally,
          but the ten thousand had lost all
          interest in the game for the after?
          noon. It was clear thatr they were
          not going to see "Babe" Ruth knock
          a home run, and nothing else mat?
          tered.
          Civic pride, inter-city rivalry, in?
          terest in the national game were
          minor considerations. The "Babe"
          was not due to "bust one."
          IN CLEVELAND 1 was talking
          to two tired business men early
          in the afternoon.
          Said one of them gravely:
          "This 'Babe' Ruth is a menace. He
          is responsible to a large degree for
          i the lack of production in these
          : manufacturing towns around the
          Lakes. Go out to the ball park to?
          day and you will see thousands of
          young men taking the afternoon off
          just to see 'Babe' Ruth 'bust one.'

          Harold Muddy Ruel, the energetic pepper box who does Washing
          ton's backstopping day in and day out in a manner which has won
          him praise all over the American League circuit, is practically a
          unanimous choice of this section of the United States of America
          for honorable mention on Babe Ruths all-American baseball com
          bination which will be instrumental in sending two readers of this
          newspaper to the world series month after next.
          In pawing through his enormous correspondence containing selec
          tions to be matched against Babes from readers of The Washing
          ton Times sporting pages, “Skillet” Finn, Esq., is strongly reminded
          of the esteem in which Ruel is held and it may be gratifying to the
          thousands of contestants for the two free world trips to know that
          their fellows are boosting Ruel for Ruths consideration.
          In “Skillet” Finn, Esq.s humble opinion, there is no better con
          clusion to draw from a thorough study of the big league catchers
          than that Muddy is a perfect all-around catcher. Whether his royal
          majesty, Babe Ruth is of the same belief remains to be seen. Its
          a Chinese cinch that the Bambino will have to look far and wide for
          a better candidate than our own little backstop, who has the admira
          tion of thousands of American League followers.

          teenth street, in inditing an all-
          American outfit to be compared
          with Babe Ruths, and in hopes
          that his choice will earn him a
          jaunt to the series with "Skillet"
          Finn, Esq., as guide and chaperon,
          says that Muddy Ruel is the
          “greatest catcher in the business.”
          Thats a pretty broad statement,
          but not overdrawn in the least, for
          it is a treat to see a catcher lik®
          Ruel back there working his head
          off every minute of the game-
          Warren Smith Hammond, 2523
          Thirteenth street, is a bit mild in
          his praise of Ruel, but names him
          with Ring and Pennock as his
          battery. He says, “Ruel is a VERY
          GOOD catcher and is no mean hand
          with the willow.” But Warren is
          only a little boy thirteen years old
          and his expression is certainly
          forceful for his years.
          Then comes the stamp of ap-
          Rroval slapped on Ruel by J. F.
          Iclnteer, of Quantico, Va. who
          earned one of the free trips to
          New York last year. With but
          a slight difference in person
          nel, Mclnteers choice of a year
          ago was almost identical to*
          Ruths, and his opinion about
          the players this season ought to
          amount to something.
          "Ruel is the best and steadiest
          catcher Ive seen this year.” writes
          Mclnteer and “Skillet” will say,
          that Mclnteer has seen plenty be
          cause the Quantico telegrapher has
          been sneaking up to Washington
          all summer long taking stock of
          the Griffmen as well as the invad
          ing teams. The remainder of his
          team outside of Ruel is: Jamieson,
          Cobb, Wluat, Kelly, Hornsby,

          “Skillet Finn, Esq.,
          “The Washington Times.
          “Dear Sir:
          “Well, as everything is back to

        <text>WORLD'S GREATEST BALL PLAYER
          ARRIVES FOR SPRING TRAINING
          «George Sisïer, Star First Baseman of the St. Louis Browns,
          Arrived in Bogalusa Tuesday—Interesting Story and
          Record of Diamond Star Taken from Baseball Maga
          zine of New' York.
          The greatest baseball player in the j
          world, George Sisler, arrived in Bo-j
          galusa Tuesday and on Wednesday j
          was at practice, enthusiastic over the
          grounds an dconvenienccs arranged j
          here for the Browns. With such ideal
          training conditions, Mr. Sisler be
          lieves that his record of last year will
          not compare with the one he intends
          to make this season. Readers of The
          Enterprise wil] be interest in the fol
          lowing story of Sisler and his won
          derful playing.
          George Sisler was the most bril
          liant player of 1920. His dazzling
          ■exploits dominate the records as those
          of Ty Cobb used to. In batting he
          was easily first with the phenomenal
          average of .407. In run scoring he
          tied for first place with Tris Speaker
          at 137 tallies. In stolen bases he was j
          second only to Sam Rice, the flyiftgj
          mercury of the Washington Senators. I
          In number of runs driven in, he tied j
          at second place with his teammate j
          -Jacobson at 122 tallies, acknowledg-j
          mg no superior but Babe Ruth. Nor j
          was his wonderful batting record in
          -any sense a fluke, for Sisler took part
          in the full schedule of 154 games and
          appeared at bat more than any other
          player, 631 times. In the number of
          his hits, he not only exceeded all com
          petitors, but broke the previous
          American League record with a grand
          total of 257 safe hits. What is more,
          he led all competitors in number of
          total bases, even Babe Ruth with his
          54 home runs being forced to take
          a back seat. Just one short of an
          «yen 400, Sisler piled up a grand to
          tal of 399 bases, a record unmatched
          in modern baseball. In two-base hits
          he was second only to Speaker. In
          "three-base hits he was second only
          to Joe Jackson. In home runs he was
          second only to Babe Ruth. Such a
          record is an all-round masterpiece
          whose like may not be seen again for
          many years.
          From his youth up a veritable gale
          of good fortune has blown George
          Sisler on his way. While he was still
          a school boy in an obscure Ohio town,
          prominent baseball men had their eye
          on him. While he was a college un
          der-graduate big league clubs were
          eager to sign him. His entry into
          major league baseball nearly precip
          itated a war of the magnates and
          was remotely responsible for the
          overthrow of the National Commis
          sion. His career with the St. Louis
          Browns has been a continuous tri
          umph, always on the upward scale,
          culminating in the grand climax of
          the season just closed. Favored by
          «verj possible talent, fleet of foot as
          an arrow, a wonderful fielder, a phe
          nomenal hitter, and when so minded,
          a brilliant pitcher, Sisler is one of the
          greatest all-round players, if not tlje
          very greatest, that baseball has ever
          produced.
          This is high, praise and yet the
          faces deserve it. In purely offensive
          departments of play, Sisler has not
          yet equalled Ty Cobb, though during
          the past season he fell little short of
          the Georgian at his best. In defense,
          however, Sisler is a better natural
          fielder than Cobb. He is furthermore
          Transfer?

          Smashing all official records for egg
          production, a little White Leghorn hen
          at Alderwood Manor demonstration
          farm, north of Seattle, hits come romp
          ing home with 326 eggs laid in twelve
          months. "Babe Ruth," its this bird is
          known, because of her championship
          performance, weighs just "Vi pounds
          and the eggs she produced in the year
          tij) the scales at ten times this weight.
          According to P. 0. MeClane, super
          intendent of the farm, who has made
          a sworn affidavit as to the accuracy
          of the record, the eggs of "Babe Ruth"
          were sold for $10 while it cost approx
          imately $4 to feed her in the twelve
          months.
          "Babe Ruth" was hatched on March
          31, 1919, and laid her first egg August
          2ti, 1919. Since that time she has been
          hard at it and has exceeded the best
          official record of 314 eggs by an even
          dozen.
          There can be no mistake about this

          always a market for young fry and
          for eggs. P|gh have always boon
          plenty in the northwest, hut in tho
          eastern states the market for domes
          ticated grown trout is very active.
          With the advent of the automobile the
          farthest mountain streams are getting
          fished out and it will only be a short
          time when trout will bo as scarce here
          |as in Now York state. Prof, Embody
          is so in earnest in his belief that rais
          ing trout is a paying business that he
          jwill give two courses in thut line in
          Ithe short term course which will be
          hold at the University beginning Janu
          jary 2 and lasting six weeks.
          egg machine has been developed. He
          shows how the trap nests used at AU
          derwood Manor imprison the hen as
          she goes on the nest to lay, after
          which she is released by an attendant
          and her number recorded and the egg
          marked.
          But "Babe Ruth" is not the only
          heavy layer in the Alderwood Manor
          flocks. Another White Leghorn in the
          pen with the champion produced 318
          eggs and two others had 307 and 306
          eggs to their credit when they finished
          the year. Eleven others laid more
          than 280 eggs in the twelve months.
          Recently government poultry ex
          perts took a number of these hens to
          the experimental station at Fairbanks,
          Alaska, all having records of more
          than 200 eggs, while the government
          only asked for 170-egg birds.
          "Babe Ruth's" record for the year
          by months follows:
          August (26, 1919), 5; September, 25;
          October, 28; November, 25; December,
          28; January, 31; Eebruary, 24; March,
          28; April, 28; May, 31; June, 28; July,
          25; August (25th), 20; total, 326.
          Like all heavy layers "Babe Ruth"
          is a heavy eater and always is busy.
          MeClane says it is the heavy eater
          and the busy bird that brings in the
          big egg yields and the large profit!,
          The Alderwood Manor demonstration
          farm has 15,000 of these White Leg
          horn egg machines and is one of the
          largest poultry farms devoted to egg
          production in the United States. Each
          spring the farm's incubators with a
          capacity of 55,000 eggs at a time are
          set to work producing layers for the
          following season.</text>

          B. E. Lundy, of the District Building staff, is determined to win a
          trip to the first block of world senes games as a guest of The
          Washington Tinies.
          Lundy probably feels that he is certain to be among the five who
          will make the coveted trip as winners in the Babe Ruth All-America
          selection contest.
          The Babe Ruth editor was slightly amazed when he received from
          Lundy exactly 40 different combinations, at least one of which Lundy
          hopes will be identical with the selections to be made by Babe Ruth.
          After reviewing thia well Informed 4
          fan'* lineups the Babe Ruth editor
          was forced to the conclusion that
          Lundy had earned, by actual toll,
          the trip he is bent upon taking as
          a prize.
          For each ot his 40 line-ups is ac
          companied by a carefully and con
          vincingly worded explanation ot why
          he chose each player.
          Lundy has set a record for Babe
          Ruth contests. His line-ups are the
          most numerous ever submitted at
          one time.
          It fa obvious to your sports
          scribe that Lundy knows his
          baseball and for that reason the
          Babe Ruth editor, as a means
          of helping other contestants, to
          give some of his views on who
          are this seasons foremost big
          league ball players.
          There are five performers who
          are without important rivals, accord
          ing to Lundys selections.' At any
          rate, in all of his 40 line ups he in
          cludes Gehrig at first base, Traynor
          at third, Jackson at shortstop, Ruel
          behind the bat, and P. Waner in
          right field.
          Hoyt, Root Ruether and Lyons are
          the only pitchers he has named.
          He is divided between Frisch and
          Hornsby at second base.
          His list of outfielders Includes
          Paul Waner, Meusel. Speaker, Sim
