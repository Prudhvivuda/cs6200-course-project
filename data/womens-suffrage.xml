        Which Enveloped World
        Woman suffrage was won for the
        women of all the states in the Union
        when Tennessee, th'e thirty-sixth state,
        ratified the Federal amendment. Ap?
        proximately 27,000,000 women will be
        entitled to vote in the Presidential
        election this fall. State suffrage al?
        ready ha^l enfranchised 17.500,000, and
        ratification adds to this number 9,500,
        000.
        Thii marks the end of the women's
        campaign for the ballot which began
        obscurely in a little meeting in Seneca
        Falls, N. Y., in 1848, swept across this
        country, and extendea the political
        freedom of women to nearly every
        other nation in the civilized world.
        Fifteen states in the United States
        already had conferred full franchise
        rights on women, and in fifteen others
        women were entitled to vote for Presi?
        dent and for certain municipal offices,
        but not for members of Congress.
        The suffrage amendment resolution
        was passed by the Congress on June 4,
        19li). Its wording was that of the orig?
        inal Susan B. Anthony amendments,
        drawn up by the pioneer suffragist soon
        after the Civil War had enfranchised
        the colored people and following the
        form of the Fifteenth Amendment. It
        reads:
        "The right of citizens of the United
        States to vote shall not be denied or
        abridged by the United States or by
        any state' on account of sex.
        "Congress shall have power by ap?
        propriate legislation to enforce the
        provisions of this article."

        Special Sessions Called
        The fact that many state legislatures
        did not hold regular sessions in 1920,
        and would be required to call special
        sessions if the .suffrage amendment
        were to become effective in time f?ir
        the Presidential elections, was the last
        great obstacle the suffrage movement
        had to overcome. Even in states
        where the women had voted for I
        many years and where ratification was
        more or less an accepted fact the Gov?
        ernors hesitated to call special ses-
        sions, for reasons of economy, or be?
        cause of local political issues which
        threatened to become embarrassing.

        suffrage amendment, should the action
        of the Tennessee Legislature to-day be
        confirmed, was promised by Secretary
        Colby when word of the vote at Nash?
        ville reached the State Department. He
        was prepared, Mr. Colby said, to issue
        the necessary proclamation immediate?
        ly on receipt of official notice that
        Tennessee had ratified the amendment.
        j When the word of ratification came
        officials of the National Woman's party
        at once sought assurances from Secre?
        tary Colby that the official action pro- j
        mulgating the amendment would not I
        be delayed. They also urged their rep?
        resentatives in Nashville to see that no
        time was lost in forwarding the official
        notice to the State Department.
        The woman's party also announced
        that steps toward a national celebra-1
        tion at the cankar liad been taken. The'
        date will be fixed later, and included in
        the ceremonies will be the presentation
        to the national Capitol of marble busts'

        will be placed either in the Hall of
