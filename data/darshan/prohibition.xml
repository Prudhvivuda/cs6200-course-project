        <text>Prohibition Enforcement
WASHINGTON, Oct. 27.?Following in the text of President Wilsons
message vetoing tlic Volstead war-time prohibition enforcement measure:
To the House of Representatives: j
I am returning without my signa?
ture IL R. 6810, an Act to prohibit
i intoxicating beverages, and to regu
late tho manufacture, production, use
and sale of high-proof spirits for
other than beverage purposes, and
to insure an ample supply of alcohol
and promote its use in scientific re?
search and in the development of
fuel, dye and other lawful industries.
The subject-matter treated in this
I measure deals with two distinct
I phases of the prohibition legislation.
One part of the act under considera?
tion seeks to enforce war-time pro?
hibition. The other provides for
the enforcement which -vas made
necessary by the adoption of the con?
stitutional amendment. I object to
and cannot approve that part of this
legislation with reference to war
time prohibition.</text>

LAW, EFFECTIVE IN
YEAR, RATIFIED
The United States has completed
the legislative process of voting itself
dry. When word was flashed over
the wires that that thirty-sixth State,

the measure.
The amendment to the Federal Con
stitution prohibiting the manufacture
and sale of intoxicating beverages

diction thereof for beverage purposes
is hereby prohibited.
Sec. 2 The Congress and the sev
eral States shall have concurrent
power to enforce this article by ap
propriate legislation.
Sec. 3 This article shall be in
operative unless it shall have been

WASHINGTON, Jan. 16 Prohibi
tion became part of the basic law of
the United States today. Ratification
of the federal amendment by the Ne
braska legislature made that measure
the eighteent amendment to the fed
eral constitution.
All but a half dozen of the forty
eight states are expected to adopt the
amendment in the next few weeks, but
the action of Nebraska today gives the
ratification of thre-fourths of the
states, the number necessary to ad
minister John Barleycorn the k. o.
punch.
One year from today every saloon,
brewery, distillery and wine press in
the land must close its doors unless
as now seems likely, they are already
closed at that time by war prohibi
tion, which goes into effect next July
1, and stays until completion of de
mobilization. The amendment which outlaws li
quor in this country reads:
Section 1. After one year from the
ratification of this article, the manu
facture, sale or transportation of In
toxicating liquor within, the importa
tion thereof into, or the exportation
thereof from the United States and all
territories subject to the jurisdiction
thereof for beverage purposes are
hereby prohibited.
Section 2. The congress and sev
eral states have the concurrent power
to enforce this article by appropriate
legislation.
Section 3. The article Rhall.be in
operative unless it shall have been rat
ified as an amendment to the consti
tution by the legislature of the sev
eral states as provided by the con
stitution within seven years of the
date of submission thereof to the states
by Congress.
This is the amendment adopted by
Congress December 18, 1917, and rati
fied by thirty-six states a little more
than a year later.
And these are some of the things
that the amendment will do:
Wipe out a stroke 236 distilleries;
992 breweries and over 300,000 saloons
and wholesale liquor establishments,
forcing thir employes to seek other
jobs.
Cut off from these persons annual
incomes totalling more than $70,000,
000 in pre-war times.
Cut off from the United States treas
ury a source of taxation counted upon
for an even billion dollars in their
first drafts in the new revenue bill
and millions in additional income to
state treasuries.
Remove the liquor question from na
tional, ate and city pontics for all
times and help increase city, state
and federal expense by decreasing law
violations.
The fight on liquor, triumphant to
day is as old as the constitution it
self. It raised its head early In the nine
teenth century and was looked upon
as another crank notion.
But it gathered strength. Churches
took it up, doctors followed and then
came the organization of anti-liquor
societies, the anti-saloon league an1
others.
In the middle of the ninteenth cen
tury Maine went dry. Kansas fol
lowed. At the end of the Civil War
the little Wind of anfi-slave agitators,
who had won their fight, seriously
considered turning to the prohibition
battle. Their number included Wil
liam Lloyd Garrison and Poet Whit
tier. About nineteen hundred came the
militant stage in the person of Car-

those ratified were submitted

rle Nation of Kansas, probably the
most picturesque figure the fight ever
developed.
Ten years later the crusade against
liquor had grown from the ravings
of cranks Snto an irresistable move
ment that swept the country.
But John Barleycorn will try to
stage a come back.
Distillers are already planning a
fight on the amendment in the courts
on the ground that it was not adopted
by two-thirds of the whole Congress
and that the seven years limitalon in
it invalidates the measure.
The drys say they are confident that
neither of these contentions will hold
and on their side are preparing legis
lation carrying heavy penalties for
prohibition. A special agency in the
internal revenue bureau will be asked.
The thirty-six states which have:
ratified the federal dry amendment up
to today and the order in which the
ratification was made are as follows:
1. Mississippi, January 8, 1918
2. Virginia. January 11, 191S.

ment.
Leader of tho Drys Expected

Tobacco,
Itenuulicnn Administration Not

Promises.
BIO FIRES ARE NOW-FREQUENT
Week after next tho Kentucky
Legislature will convene and the
eyes of tho country will be turned
this way, as this toody will bo the
first to act on the new prohibition
law just passed in Washington.
Those familiar with the affairs of
this State realize that tho coming
Legislature is practically committed
fo a prohibition amendment, but Its
action will toe heralded broadcast by
the Prohibitionists that Kentucky is
anxious to go into the dry column
and is more than half way ready
to adopt the constitutional amend
ment as submitted by Congress
and tho Senate. All of tho
Kentucky leaders of Democracy
from Gov. Stanley down are
In favor of submitting tho
question of State-wide prohibition tp
the people, and regardless of the
action of our .national bodies it Is
hoped that the people of Kentucky
will be given an opportunity to
register their opposition to this
narrow-minded and fanatical meas
ure. One consoling thought to the
people of this State will be that this
legislation marks the passing of the
hypocrites and fakers who have
made Frankfort their headquarters
at every legislative session. The
usual figure-heads of this clan are
the down-and-out country preach
ers who; not able to secure a
church or congregation, use prohibi
tion as their means of making a
livelihood. They are assisted by
tho narrow-minded fanatics who
are insane on the subject, and last
but not least the wily politician, who
uses the Anti-saloon Leaguers and
the Prohibitionists to further his
political ends.
Kentucky has been cursed with
prohibition politics for tho past sev
eral years and it will toe a relief to
have tho question settled by the
people. There has hardly been a
Democratic political convention or
primary that Haly and Beckham
have not held the bugaboq prohibi
tion up to control the party, and
good men have been driven from
active service because they could
not seo their way clear to ,hark
back to tho days of Salem wlth
craft and Puritan fanaticism. In
their places sprung up unknown,
obscure and Incompetent Demo
cratic leaders, under the guise of
Forward Leaguers, who presumed
to dictato to tho party as a whole.
The passage of the prohibition
amendment means, back to ob
scurity for them, unless they Join
the anti-tobacco reformers, who
hope to follow in tho footsteps of
the Prohibitionists. In tho Re
publican party stirring old leaders
like Senator Bradley and ex-Go v.
Willson have been succeeded by the
Republican Prohibitionists like Hert,
ORear, Bruner and Morrow, all of
whom are advocates of down with
the demons rum, beer and wine,
and probably unintentional advo
cates of the soft drink dope syrups.
Thus tooth political parties .will be
in tho humor for a house cleaning
after the prohibition question is
settled.

also passed by a two-thirds majority
the re.jolutior., but that this will be
done is not doubted by the most en
thusiastic wets. The highest hope of
the wets now to stave off the vote
:n the House until next session. The
House has until the expiration of the
present Congre??, on March I, lJl>, to
pass the amendment, so to nullify to
days action in the Senate the wets
would have to stave off a vote in the
House until after that date.
Senators said o-night that this is the
first time in the countrys history that
a constitutional amendment. hns ever
had a time limit string to it. Thirty
six states. the necessary three-fourths
to ratify a constitutional amendment,
must have approved the bone-dry
amendment within six years following
the date the resolution is flnally passed
by both houses or it will fall to th
grcund. If, six years after the House
nas passed the amendment adopted by
the Senate to-dav, only thirty-tive or
fewer states shali have approved it, all
the work done in getting the resolution
through I ongress and in getting those
thirty-nve legislatures to ratify it will
be lost.
Flght To Be Transferrcd
So the passage of the resolution bv
the House, which is eonceded to be
coraing, whethei this session or next,
will transfer the flght of the pro-
hibition forces to the state legi?-
iatures. The real battle will lie in a
tew states. It is probable, for in
stanre that but little atten.ion will be
wasfd on such states as New York
and \?w Jersey. The drys virtualiy
have twcnty-flve sure states states
which nrf now bone dry or nearly so,
Bt that they will only have to make an
upbill battle in eleven additional states
to ratify the amendment.
Ono or the bijrgr?t surprises of the
day was not he vote on the final
adoption of the amendment, though
this was much larger than expected,
but the vote on r.n amendment by Sen?
ator Nevlar.ils. This would have made
the prohibition against -distilled
liquors, insiead of intoxicating
liquors, and would have saved light
wines and beer. It was defcated, 67 I
to 22.
Hy practically tha same vote tho
Senate refused to adopt a plan of Sen
Bttl Pnelan, of California, which would
have given the state legislatures the
right to pass either on a bone dry
amendn ent, or one prohibiting mereiy
diatilled liquors.
Senator Stone, of Missouri, one of
the prnnouncvl opponents of prohibi?
tion, trtatod the Scm.t BBd fralleries
to another surpr.se. Waiting until the
clerk was reading the list of how the
Senators had voted. he \oted for the
r.m.endment. At once his col!eag-je,
Senator Reed. another pronouneed anti
prohibitioni-t, rushed to his desk.
After a hurried confab, he stood up
and addressed the Chair. He voted no.
This does not rcprcsent a conversion
on Mr. Stones part, but mereiy his
idea hat the states should have the
right to determine the question.</text>

        <text>ADDRESS OF GOVERNOR W. R. STUBBS OF KANSAS, 
AT CHICAGO, SUNDAY, MARCH 27. 

In Which He Tells What Constitutional Prohibition Has Done for Kansas, 
Giving a Great Many Documents in Support of His Argument. 

I came to Chicago to defend the fair name of Kansas against the slanders of 
those whose interest it is to see our laws violated, our civilization defamed and 
our state policies impeached. 

I am going to furnish you and the country exact and indisputable facts 
concerning the enforcement and operation of the prohibition law in Kansas. 
The proof which I shall submit to you would be accepted as conclusive evidence 
before any court in the United States. 

I am anxious to know whether the good people of Chicago are willing to 
credit the statemn ;s of a combination of brewers and saloonkeepers who are 
spending hundred? of thousands of dollars annually to poison public opinion, 
and debauch t^e iaw in preference to the statements of those who are standing 
up for : 1, American home, working and pleading for decency in public life and 
making effo; ; in every direction to build up a great state on the foundation of a 
wholesome morality. 

I did not come here as a politician, for I have never yet had either the time 
or the inclination to iearn the laws or tricks of scientific politics. 

1 have never made a prohibition speech in my life. I am a practical, plain- 
speaking business man and while I regard the moral and sentimental sides of 
the question as constituting its strongest claim on society for support I propose, 
to a very large extent, to discuss the subject from a cold-blooded, economic 
standpoint. In other words, I am going to present it to you as a sound business 
proposition. 

When I was a candidate for governor in 1908 I made the campaign for my 
nomination and election on the proposition that if elected to this office every 
saloon, joint and place of every kind whatever regardless of the sentiment of 
the community had to be closed. This proposition was made in my campaign 
speeches to the saloon men in wet communities as well as to temperance 
people; I stated publicly all over Kansas — in Pittsburg in the mining districts 
as well as the localities where the law was enforced — that any man who estab- 
lished himself in the saloon business in violation of the laws and constitution 
of Kansas would be regarded the same as any other outlaw, and all the power 
and force of the state government would be used to punish and destroy his 
business. 

This does not mean that we have no violations of the prohibitory law, 
for if there were no violations such a law would not be necessary. It does 
mean that the prohibitory law in Kansas is as well enforced as other criminal 
statutes, and that when men violate it they are arrested, convicted and promptly 
sent to prison. 

The United States government has taken a step which will aid materially in 
stamping out the irresponsible bootlegger and whiskey vender who now is 
the principal violator of the prohibitory law in Kansas. Under direction of 
President Taft the Attorney General of the United States has ordered United 
States district attorneys in  dry territory not to compromise with men who 
violate the internal revenue laws by permitting them to pay fines, but to prose- 
cute them and send them to jail for a reasonable time. 

I want to especially impress the fact upon your mind that while Kansas had 
substantial prohibition for twenty-eight years it has had absolute prohibition 
only since May, 1909. Previous to this time liquor was allowed to be sold 
through licensed pharmacists, for medicinal, mechanical and scientific purposes. 
Abuse of this privilege led to dissatisfaction and the last legislature wiped out 
all exceptions and made the state absolutely dry. Before they could sell 
intoxicating liquors these pharmacists had to obtain an internal revenue stamp 
and it is upon this circumstance in part that the agents and spokesmen of the 
breweries and the distilleries are trying to deceive you by showing the number 
of so-called licenses issued in Kansas last year. 

A further explanation of the number of licenses issued in Kansas is found 
in the method of handling violators of the Federal stamp law. When our state 
officers arrest a man for selling liquor they notify the internal revenue officers, 
who come to him at once and collect a Federal license tax, often times finding 
the man in jail. This man is then quoted by the breweries, distilleries and sa- 
loon men of other- states as a saloonkeeper in Kansas, when in fact he is either 



in jail, paroled during good behavior, or under injunction never to again engage 
in liquor selling in our state. 

Under our state law the finding of a Federal license stamp in a place fitted 
up for the sale of intoxicating liquors is primae facie evidence of violation of 
the prohibitory law, and I challenge the brewers and distillers to show one in- 
ternal revenue liquor stamp posted in a saloon or joint in Kansas. 

While I am not an expert in the affairs of the local government of Chicago 
I venture the assertion that conditions which are due largely to the saloon and 
kindred evils of society constitute your most disturbing and distracting prob- 
lems. Usually cities having an ambition to solve such problems commission 
delegations of its wisest and best citizens to investigate the treatment of these 
problems by other communities. As chief executive of my state it would give 
me great pleasure to welcome delegations from Chicago to Kansas for the 
purpose of showing them the results of prohibition. We have had commis- 
sioners from Canada, New Zealand, England and Australia and even now the 
governments of Italy and Russia are investigating our methods of dealing with 
this evil, the greatest social and governmental problem on the face of the earth 
today. 

If wisdom should cause you to send such a delegation to Kansas I will 
guarantee they will not find a business man of standing in the state who will 
not testify that prohibition is the best business asset of Kansas. 

Prohibition must be judged by results — it must stand or fall upon its 
merits. The people of Kansas are very progressive, very positive and intensely 
practical in their ideas and habits. If the prohibitory law had not given us a 
better civilization and a higher type of manhood and womanhood it would have 
been repealed years ago. If it has increased drunkenness, crime and perjury, 
as saloon men claim it has done, the saloonkeepers would all be supporting the 
law instead of fighting it, for it would increase their revenue. 

This is .an age of conservation. Prohibiting the manufacture and sale of 
whiskey is more closely identified with a sound conservation policy than are the 
laws prohibiting the wanton destruction of the forests. </text>

THE LEGAL ASPECT OF PROHIBITION. 

JOHN CLEMENS BENTON. 

The prohibition movement grows apace. Indeed, it 
may be said, at last, to have attained the dignity of a 
national question. True, Congress has not as yet under- 
taken to legislate on the subject; and in fact, it has no 
power to do so &amp;in so far as the general public is con- 
cerned&amp; if the provisions of a seemingly obsolescent Con- 
stitution are of any force and effect whatever. True, 
also, that both of the great political parties continue to 
ignore the movement in their platforms. Nevertheless, 
ir many sections of the country it constitutes the most 
important local issue, and in all sections it is a more or 
less engrossing topic of political discussion. 

Already prohibitory liquor laws obtain in many 
States and communities, and, if we can credit current 
statistics, forty per cent, of the people of the United 
States chafe under their iniquitous and exasperating re- 
strictions. And, notwithstanding legal fictions to the con- 
trary, these laws do, in fact, deprive persons of property 
without due process of law; they do, in fact, impair the 
obligations of contracts, and they do, in fact, deprive the 
people of vested rights contrary to the letter and spirit 
of the Constitution. Moreover, they impede the growth 
and commerce of individual communities, thereby im- 
pairing the general prosperity of the Nation; they se- 
riously cripple the national revenue, and they tend to 
revolutionize the accepted theory of constitutional gov- 
ernment. 

For these reasons the question may be considered 
national, and, perhaps, the most important national ques- 
tion at present confronting the American people; the 
one of all others now pending most directly affecting the 
rights and- liberties of the people, and one upon the
