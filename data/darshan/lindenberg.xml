TRENTON, N. J., March 2.—After
Governor A. Harjy Moore had an

capture of the Lindbergh baby kid

Moore telephoned the distraught

WASHINGTON, March 2.—De
mands for prompt action by con
gress on bills empowering the fed
eral government to act in kidnaping
cases were made in both the sen
ate and house today by speakers,
who called attention to the Lind
bergh baby abduction.
Senator Barbour Rep., N. J. who
succeeded the late Dwight W. Mor

while Representative Seger Rep.,
N. J. made a similar plea from the
floor of the house.
The house postoffice committee
acted promptly today on a measure
aimed at kidnapers, reporting out
thte bill of Representative Cochrane

of twenty years in jail and $5,000
fine for sending threatening, black

the mail.
Senator Bingham Rep., Conn.,
a close friend of the Lindberghs,
said the kidnaping “brings vividly
to the minds of the American peo
ple the need for some legislation to
curb this growing crime.”
Senator King Dem.. Utah, a
member of the senate judiciary
committee, said the “horrible sit

“The Lindbergh case emphasizes
the necessity for the government
stepping in, without encouraching
on state powers, to help stamp out

HOPEWELL, N. J., March
2.—Charles Augustus Lind
bergh Jr., blue-eyed and fair
haired, 20-months-old child of
Colonel and Mrs. Lindbergh is
held today for $50,000 ran
som.
Seized in his crib Tuesday night
as he lay slumbering and ill of a
cold, the baby was taken away by
kidnapers, one of whom is believed
to be a woman.
With cold daring, the actual kid
napers crept up a short sectional
ladder into the second-floor nur-j
sery some time between 7:30 and
10 p. m., took the child down the
ladder, and left behind the ransom j
demand, a note dropped in the
empty crib.
Lindy Willing to ray
Colonel Lindbergh is willing to
pay the kidnapers the ransom they
demand, it was stated authorita
tively here today, “if they will make
known the means and the occasion !
lor so doing.”
The note, demanding the $50,000
for the childs freedom, was report
ed to have said in substance:
“We will be back tomorrow
Wednesday to talk business. Dont
talk to the police or the papers. i
Colonel Lindbergh, grim and re
ticent, aided in searching for the
kidnapers, and was represented as
ready personally to enter direct ne
gotiations for the childs return.
Sensation Is World-Wide
Meantime, the kidnaping created
a world-wide sensation.
Literally thousands of police and
state troopers were put oh alarm
guard, watching highways, and
state and national boundary lines.
Over the teletype wires of the
eastern .states and up along the
Canadian border flashed word that i
one of the nations most famous
babies had been stolen.
The kidnaper apparently had not
realized the furore and resentment
their deed would cause.
Police everywhere went to work
with a will to come up with the
kidnapers, while the federal depart
ments of justice, commerce and
treasury in Washington offered to
do all within their power to track
down the criminals.
President Hoover manifested his
interest..
Aviators from many parts of the
country offered their services, and
an air comrade was sent aloft this
morning to see if from the skies
he could see anything along the
roadways of valuue to the search.
The commerce department was
ready also to help with pilots.
Colonel Leads in Search
Colonel Lindbergh, worn by the
anxiety of his predicament, worked
side by side with the state police.
During the night he helped to trace |
down tracks on his property in the |
fastnesses of the Sourland moun
tains.
During the forenoon he went on
a mysterious errand with Lieuten
ant John Keaton of the New Jer
sey state police. They sed away
two men. One of these had approximately size 10 feet; the othei
size 8.
There was mud on the window sill and inside the nursery on the
floor. There were no fingerprints on the window sill.
The kidnapers apparently gjore gloves. One man probably entered
the room, while ar*her watched outside, and they departed byrauto

Dislike for Strangers
May Betray Abductors
By United firess
MEADVILLE. Pa.. March 2.—Strong resemblance of Charles
Augustus Lindbergh Jr. to his father, and his “hearty dislike of
strangers” may lead to early return of the child, his grand-aunt,
Mrs. Hilda Morrow- Mellvaine, Meadville, sister of the late Dwight
Morrow believes.
•The baby looks so much like his father that no one could mis
take his identity,” Mrs. Mellvaine said. -And he heartily dislikes
strangers.
"I know he will cry and fuss and be unmanageable with his
kidnapers, possibly betraying them.
“He is unusually bright, walking and talking in a way far be
yond his twenty months. His aunt, Miss Elizabeth Morrow, takes
him to her nursery school in Englewood, N J., frequently.
“After his first shyness he was at ease in the kindergarten,
playing w-ith older boys and girls. He even learned to count to five.
“He can walk faster than many adults. He has some clever
little tricks, too, such as talking on the telephone. If he ever gets
into a room where there is a telephone he will persist in taking dow-n
th receiver, perhaps giving the operator a clew to his presence.”
in a fast car and came back a cou
ple of hours later on foot through
the woods.
Rumor had it that they had vis
ited Flagtown where a group of sus
pected bootleggers were believed
to be.
Meantime. Mrs. Lindbergh, deep
ly stirred, bore up with the cour
age of a Spartan mother.
The first word prostrated her, but
it was not long before she was ex
hibiting the same courage as her
husband, and she helped authorities.
Once she joined searchers for a
short period.
Many Clews Traced
Her burden was all the greater
for she had been nursing the child
several days because of a cold. And
the kidnapers, without even trying
to catch up some quilts, dragged
the baby off, clad only in its “sleep
er.” Moreover, Mrs. Lindbergh is
again an expectant mother.
Many clews were run down, only
to end disappointingly.
Before dawn, a Philadelphia truck
driver reported sighting beside the
rcadway, not fan. from the Lind
bergh home, a bundle which ap
peared similar to a baby or a doll.
Troopers hurried to the scene on
fast motorcycles, but found that all
the man had seen was a bundle of
papers.
More than a dozen motor cars
were reported stolen in New Jersey
yesterday, and these were checked
in the hope of furnishing a clew.
The only one which appeared
hopeful was an abandoned car
found near Hillside, N. J—a car
stolen from a Brooklyn man. Its
headlights were streaming, and it
matched description of a blue Nash
sedan in which two men at dark
Tuesday inquired at Princeton for
the way to the Lindbergh estate.
Dog Fails to See Abductors
Police thought the inquiries might
have been the kidnapers or their
advance men. But they were at a
loss to reconcile this with evidence
that the kidnapers were familiar
with the field in which they op
erated.
A faithful dog, always alert, made
no sound, as far as is known, dur
ing the visit of the kidnaper to
the nursery on the second floor.
The man may have made friends
earlier with the animal.
The kidnaping visit was well
timed. The baby had been put to
bed and Mrs. Lindbergh had kissed
him good-night at about 7:30.
Later in the evening, the nurse
maid, Betty Gow, was startled to
find the crib empty, and the child
nowhere to be found. She gave
the alarm, and then the authorities
were summoned.
But by this time the kidnaper
had a good start.
The ladder the kidnaper used
HOME
TWO CENTS
yielded little help. Evidently he
had been gloved, and his feet either
were stockinged or his shoes cov
ered to blur the shoeprint.
The ladder had cracked as he
came down, and there is a chance
he fell, injuring himself and the
child.
Had Woman Accomplice
His tracks led out of the estate
toward the main road, where a
womans footprints appeared. This
gave the clews that the kidnapers
had a woman accomplice, who
should watch over the baby until
l such time as they could bargain for
for their ransom.
A chisel was found in the woods
near the house, but there was noth
ing to link that definitely with the
: crime.
Workmen who had helped to re
build the natural rock house on the
mountainside were checked over to
! see if they had knowledge of any
i prowlers, but so far as police re
| vealed there was nothing yielded,
i All the present and past employes
were said to have been exonerated.
Beside the press and photograph
ers, there came scores of autos with
the curious, and these jammed the
roads nearby for several miles.
The milkman arrived at 10:30
a. m., evidently unaware of the kid
naping, and delivered four quarts
of milk and two pints of cream,
most of which was for the little
baby.
Mrs. Dwight W. Morrow, mother
of Mrs. Lindbergh, arrived at the.
Lindberg home early this morning
to be with her daughter. She mo
tored down from her home at En
glewood and declined to comment
on the kidnaping as she entered the
big stone house.
Fears Child Will Suffer
“The poor child has had a cold
and will suffer,” Mrs. Lindbergh said
broken-hearted. “We have been
doctoring him for several days.”
Colonel Lindbergh, quiet but
manifestly suffering from terrific
strain, said he suspected no one, and
observed:
“They must have got through
that window” pointing to a
screened window which would not
close because it was warped.
Baby Lindbergh was tucked in his
crib at 7:30 p. m. His mother kissed
him good night, after trying vainly
to fasten a loose, warped screen in
the nursery on the second floor.
About 10 p. m. the nursemaid
entered to see that her charge
was sleeping soundly. She found
to her horror that his crib
was empty. She though at first he
might have fallen or crawled out.
But a search of the room soon
showed her that he had been stolen.
She screamed to the Lindberghs.
The police know only that the in
truder had used a ladder, put up
in sections, had scaled it into the
nursery, and there left a note—a
ransom demand for $50,000; then
had scrambled .down the ladder,
making his way to a point down
“Featherbed Lane” toward the main
highway.
Joined by Woman
On this path, according to foot
prints, the kidnaper was joined by
a woman accomplice.
The spot where the kidnaping
took place is remote, situated up a
rocky roadway off a main thorough
fare.
Olie Whateley, chauffeur-butler,
was convinced the kidnaping had
been planned carefully. This con
viction arose from the fact that a
fox terrier, usually alert, was not
heard to make any disturbance dur
ing the evening, leading to the be
lie that the intruder perhaps was
someone the dog recognized.

Seven Notes Received
It was learned from an authorita

were sent first to Col. Henry Breck

HOPEWELL, N. J., May 13. New
Jersey authorities, backed by the mighty
police power of the federal government, to
day apparently were on the direct trail of the
kidnapers and murderers of the Lindbergh
baby.
Shortly after President Hoover had
called on the government heads to make the
murder of the baby “a live and never-to-be
forgotten case,* it dramatically was revealed
that Colonel Lindberghs emissaries had been
in actual contact with the men believed with
out question to be the kidnapers.
The revelation came through Dr. John
F. Condon, the “Jafsie of the want ads,” who
paid out $50,000 for Colonel Lindbergh to the
kidnapers, and was double-crossed.
Under examination by authorities, he
disclosed that the men had sent as a “token”
of identification for Colonel Charles A. Lind
bergh the sleeping suit they had taken from
the kidnaped child.
Relentless Hunt Is Pushed
lhe suit convinced Lindbergh the men had the
baby and the money was paid, although the little vic
tims body then was lying in the rain soaked Jersey
woods.
Authorities, at last, on a definite trail, are no long
er hampered by the previous fear the baby would be
harmed, have started relentlessly on the trail of those
with whom Condon dealt.
They have as first clew the message from the
gang to Jafsie, and the knowledge of their w-here
abouts on the night the money was paid in the bronx.
Condon and John Hughes Curtis, the Norfolk
negotiator, moreover are expected to furnish other
information that would guide police to the killers,
now the object of the most relentless and widespread
hunt in the history of crime.

Baby Lindbergh's crib became the symbol of a nation's grief as
word was flashed from Hopewell of*the discovery of the child's body
in a gulley near Ml. Rose. N. J. This photo shows the crib in the

the manufacturer's serial number on a lapel on the collar.
Through this number Lindbergh traced it to the store
where the baby's clothes had been purchased.
He felt then Condon was in contact with the kidnapers,
and the $50,000 was paid out.
When the baby was kidnaped, it wore three garments—
a flannel belly hand, a flannel undershirt and the sleeping
garment. The sleeping garment was missing from the body.
Marshalls revelations recalled one of the series of news
paper advertisements through which Condon communicated
with the kidnapers. It said. “The package had been received''
and that “the party" considered it “the real goods."
Betty Go\\. who viewed the mutilated body and positive
ly identified it as the Lindbergh baby, was positive because
of the undershirt on the body when it was found.
It had been too long for the baby and she had cut off the
end and sewed a hem with blue thread, Marshall said.
Discovery of the pitiful, mutilated corpse, with the skull
crushed, at Mount Rose Hill Thursday afternoon, less than
five miles from the Lindbergh home, horrified the nation.
The child for which the world has been searching for
two and a half months was murdered soon after the kidnap
ing—perhaps on the night of the kidnaping itself.
Mrs. Lindbergh was at home when they brought her the
news. Her grief and shock were hidden from the world, al
though she was said to be bearing up bravely within the
closely-guarded Sourland hills home the Lindberghs had built.
It had been planned as a safe retreat in which to rear
their child and have their home life.

of April 2 when Lindy drove "Jafsie" to a cemetery rendezvous
with the kidnap gang's agent. There 150.000 was traded for a note

Then early today Dr. Phillip D. Inges, New York, phy

It was 3:15 p. m. Thursday when a Negro truck driver
and his helper found the skeleton in a clump of woods about
four and a half miles south of the Lindbergh home near the
tiny hamlet of Mt. Rosp.
The baby had been killed, appar

body secreted in the woods about
seventy-five feet, from the road.

gone. Remnants of the child's
blond curly hair clung to the skull.

WASHINGTON, May 13. President
Hoover today issued orders to the secret
service of the federal government to “make
the kidnaping and murder of the Lindbergh
baby a live and never-to-be-forgotten case.”
The President, in a brief, terse state
ment, ordered the federal government
agencies never to relax “until those criminals
are implacably brought to justice.”
The Presidents statement said:
“I have directed the law enforcement
agencies and the several secret services of
the federal government to make the kidnap
ing and murder of the Lindbergh baby a live
and never-to-be-forgotten case, never to be
relaxed until those criminals are implacably
brought to justice.”
Sends Message of Condolence
The Presidents message was flashed immediately
to all the governments law enforcement agencies, and
sudden activity ran like magic through the depart
ments concerned.
Attorney-General William Mitchell, arriving at
the White House for the Friday cabinet meeting, said
he had relayed the Presidents message “to all the en
forcement agencies under my command.
President Hoover also dispatched a message of
condolence to the Lindbergh family.
The President's order throws into tho case not only the
department of justice and its various agencies, the prohibi
tion bureau, the treasury secret service and the coast guard,
all the army of the United States, marshals and other govern
ment forces, but conceivably even could extend to the use
of the army and navy intelligence services which extend to
almost every corner of the earth.
Trained Detectives Are Available
One important phase of the federal activity periainet
to the $50,000 in notes paid by Lindbergh in the ransom hoax.
Secret service men have been pursuing clews with all
the deftness and skill accumulated during a long period of
success in this field of detection.
' It was regarded as highly improbable that the trained
investigators assigned to the case would fail to get result*.
Passage of federal legislation which at least could reach kidnapers
who take advantage of present deficiencies in laws by fleeing from one

Officers in Boston to Probe '
Lindbergh Case. j
BULLETIN.
BOSTON. October 24 OP.—Lieut
James Finn of the New York Police
Department today said that infor
mation gained from John Gorch
provided a clue to the kidnapers
of the Lindbergh baby. Finn said:
"Gorch provided us with names I
and addresses in New York. These
will have to be checked up. What j
they will prove to be I can't say 1
now.”
By the Associated Press.
BOSTON. October 24—Police offi
cials of New York and New Jersey
came to Boston today and questioned
John Gorch, 37, in an effort to deter
mine whether he had anything to do
with the collection of $50,000 ransom
money paid for the kidnaped Lindbergh
baby.
Lieut. James Finn, a member of the
New York Police Department, who at
one time served as bodyguard for Col.
Charles A. Lindbergh and who has
never relinquished the search for the
baby's kidnapers, came to Boston, ac
companied by Corpl. William F. Home,
representative of Col. H. Norman
Schwartzkopf of the New Jersey State
police.
Before going to the Charles Street
Jail, where Gorch is confined, the offi
cers conferred with Deputy Supt. James
McDevitt at headquarters.
So important is Gorch considered in
the renewed Investigation of the pay
ment of $50,000 at a time when the
body of the slain Lindbergh baby was
lying beside a roadway at Hbpewell,
N. J„ that Dr. John F. Condon, known
as “Jafsie” during the investigation of
the kidnaping, was reported ready to
come to Boston to view Gorch.
During the transaction Dr. Condon
knew the man with whom he was deal
ing only as “John, the Pole.” Police
point out that not only is Gorchs first
name John, but also he is Polish ex
traction and at one time lived near
HopeweU.
Local officials of the Department of
Justice announced today that a com
parison at Washington of the serial
numbers of five $100 bills and several
smaller notes found on Gorch showed
they were not a part of the Lindbergh
ransom money. Federal agents con
tinued, however, to study his story of
his movements since the Lindbergh
kidnaping.

she heard of her husband's death.
She broke away from friends

She remained behind the locked

with her to come out.
In her room on the eighth floor

"Oh, niy God!" she shouted.
"Oh why did you do this to hini!"|
Or. William Collier tried to ad-j

TRENTON, N. J., April 4.—
UP—The slate of New Jersey,
which sper.t $1,200,000 to capture
and convict Bruno Richard Haupt
mann, executed thim last night
with a penny s worth of electric
ity.
Hauptmann entered the door of
the death house at i-tate prison at
8:41 p. m.
The first of three shocks went
through his body at 8:42 1-2.
Physicians pronounced him dead
at 8:47 1-2 p. in.
Before his body ever hung loose
and heavy against the straps of
the electric chair, officials collect
ed from witnesses a dozen affi
davits, swearing that Hauptmann
had died in the place, time and
manner prescribed by law. Then
they closed their four-year file on
the murder of Charles A. Lind
bergh, Jr.
Hauptmann died without con
fessing.
Not a word passed his lips as he
entered the electrocution chamber
and he needed no assistance when
he sat down in the chair.
Nothing that a man covets —
money, security for his family,
not even the prospects of escap
ing the thunderbolt that hit him
last night—could persuade Haupt
mann to tell why and how and
he kUUd Liodbsrgh
baby.
His failure to confess left a
trail of doubt around the world.
Millions, including the governor
of New Jersey, believed no one
man could have committed the
crime, and that the law did only
part of its work on the spring eve
ning four years and a month from
the night when the Lindbergh
baby was kidnaped.
For these millions, a murdered
child still cries out for vengeance
and they will believe through all
their years that sometime and
somewhere a frightened m in is
?oing to whisper from his r'c? h
bed that he, too, had a part in the
bloody business on Sourland
mountain.
But when Hauptmann walked
to his death he did so in the
knowledge that his lawyers and
his wife, Anna, had tried and test
ed every safeguard' of the law and
that he still stood convicted and
guilty.
For one breathless fragment of
a minute last night every heart
stood still in the little white-wall
ed room where death and Haupt
mann met. It was when the door
swung.
There stood tiauptmann s
For five beats of your heart he
did not move, but waited for the
door to come wide enough for him
and his guards to get through.
It was his eyes yoli noticed
first. They were strange, unblink
ing eyes—cold eyes of washed-out
blue.
They had dressed him for death
in a gray shirt open at the throat,
in shapeless brown trousers and
bedroom slippers. At first glance,
only his eyes identified him as be
ing the man who sat directly in
front of the United Pi-ess cor
respondent at FlentSr^ton dur
ing the six weeks of his trial.
They had clipped the hair of his
skull, and it gleamed, white and
hard ?n the light.
Robert Elliott, the executioner,
stood beside a bucket of brine in
which he was soaking the sponges
to be u:M?d on Houptmann—a
wrinkled old mechanic of death,
puttering around with his tool?.
Thw were more than 60 persons
crowded into one corner of the
room, hut if Hauptmann saw
them th*y must, have been noth
ing but a blur of face* to him.
Only one thing stands out dark
and stark in that white room—
the oak chair with its heavy
leather straps.
And that chair was the fir?1
thing Hauptmann saw aa he canu
through the door with a guard
grasping each arm. It was not the
first time he had looked death in
the eye. He saw it down tbc stun
by barrel of a machine gun dur
ing the World war; saw it coming
at him across the fields in the
shape of men dressed in French
horizon bltse and British brown.
But he couki fight back st death
then, give it blow for blow and
come through, as he did, un
scathed. There was no fighting
back now, and he knew it.
His face was pasty, mayba with
fright and maybe only with the
pallor that prison puts on men
who never see the sun. He seemed
to have courage, if courage means
that the brain tells the legs , to

NEW YORK. April 16 —Revelations concerning the futile flight
to Marthas Vineyard two weeks ago by Col. Lindbergh and three com
panions, including disclosure that the mysterious fourth member of
the party was a Federal officer, Elmer L. Irey, of Capone investiga
tion fame, can be made tonight on indisputable authority.
Lured by a heart-rending bit of Baby Lindy's sleeping garment.
Lindbergh, irey. Col. Henry Breckinridge and Dr. John F. Condon

yacht on wmcn the quartet expected to find
the kidnaped baby in custody of two "inno
cent” women.
Women Were to Be Questioned.
Irey, chief of the Internal Revenue Bu- j
reaus intelligence unit, was ready not only,
to tender Uncle Sam's aid in recovering
Charles Augustus, jr., but to question the i
women as to their connection with the case. |
Through it all Col. Lindbergh held to a de
termination to play fair with the kidnapers
if they kept faith with him under the solemn
contract entered into by Jafsle in the melo
dramatic surroundings of a graveyard.
In accordance with this “code of honor”
Lindbergh requested Irey and his two “aces.”
Frank Wilson and A. P. Madden, to remain
aw'ay from the actual scene of the $50,000
ransom transaction, but permitted Irey to
join in the climactic quest for the baby and
its “guiltless” guardians.
Respects 8-Hour Start Demand.
The kidnapers had demanded eight hours start after payment 1
of the ransom, and Lindbergh, not suspecting a trick, allowed that I
period to expire before he launched the hunt for the Nellie off Cutty- I
hunk, Mass. ___'

belief that the kidnapers would keep
faith was the  little package” delivered
to Dr. Condon April 1 It was half
of an infant's sleeping dress. Col. and
Mrs. Lindbergh and Betty Gow. the
nurse, were convinced after careful ex
amination of the garment that it was,
as Jafsie said in a newspaper advertise
ment, “the real article."
Stakes All on Pledges.
Without waiting to press further his
reiterated requests for the babys flnger
; prints, for comparison with a set of
! latent" prints obtained from toys and
! furniture in the nursery, Lindbergh,
with the advice of others, decided to
pin all his hopes on the pledges of
those who had stolen his son.
The babys garment was delivered on
Friday, April 1. The ransom was paid
the next night by Dr. Condon, who
handed to a shadowy figure behind a
cemetery wall a box containing the
$50,000 in five, ten and twenty dollar
bills. Most of the circumstances of that
transaction already have become public.
The Star now can reveal many of the
events that Immediately followed pay

On Saturday night, about 9:30

TbJfce and A1 Jteich, an amateur prize
fighter, dAve in Lindbergh's car to the
Bronx home of Dr. Condon. They car
ried two black suitcases and an arm
ful of heavy wraps.
Col. Lindbergh and Dr. Condon, w'ith
the $50,000 in a box. then drove to the
eerie rendezvous with the emissary of
the kidnapers. Col. Lindbergh remain
ing a short distance away in the car.
Dr. Condon was accosted as he walked
along the cemetary wall and he turned
the box and its contents over to a man
of Scandinavian or Teutonic accent,
whom he recognized from previous
meetings.
designated in the letter soon was recog
nized, with a concerted cry of elation.
All eyes were strained for a glimpse
of the yacht called "Nellie."
But the Nellie was not there.
Nearby, however, could be seen a
number of boats, scattered along the
inlets and bays.
Search in Vain.
Lindbergh zoomed down again and
again, until it seemed the undercarriage
cf the plane would clip the rigging of
the boats beneath, or touch the sun
tinted waters of the sound. He was try
ing to read the names on the sides of
the craft that seemed to answer the |
general description of the Nellie. I
There were yachts with a wide variety i
of girls' names, except that sought.
Grimly. Lindbergh and his associates j
continued the disheartening search.
The plane circled the Island and ven- '
tured to ether nearby shores of the !
Marthas Vineyard area. It was hopi-d I
the Nellie would see or hear the !
plane and signal to It In some way. j
Perhaps those on the yacht had mis
understood directions of their own j
group and were in the wrong location, j
If this were the case it would be ad- j
visable to cover a wide territory.
With ever-increasing misgivings, the ]
plane continued to circle over the j
neighborhood. At ope time the plane
was landed at the village of Cuttyhunk
and the group went ashore and Inquired
of the seafaring folk there whether they
knew anything of the Nellie.
No one had heard of such a boat In
that vicinity.
Lindbergh Recognized.
Lunch was eaten in the village. It
was during this visit to the town that
Lindbergh was recognized by several of
the residents. One of the villagers
noticed the name "Breckinridge" on a
wallet. It was in this way that word
of the flight first leaked out. It was
not until later that Dr. Condon s
identity was disclosed, and the fourth
man has been variously reported as
having been John H. Curtis. Norfolk
"intermediary": John Fogarty, private
detective, and others.
Lindbergh refused to give up hope.
All day long he wheeled the plane over
Cuttyhunk and Marthas Vineyard. Onlv |
the darkening shadows of eventide in - |
duced him to call the expedition off j
for the day.
Crushed with pent-up emotion, the
searchers returned sorrowfully to New
York that night.
Lindbergh could not bring himself to
believe he had been deliberately double
crossed He argued there must have
been some unintentional slip In the ar
rangements.
Second Flight Made.
Tlie first thing Monday he and Col.
Brecken ridge again flew back to Cutty
hunk and renewed the quest. This trip,
too ended in failure.
Meanwhile Dr. Condon eagerlv had
been awaiting word from his "contact
man.” Tuesday passed, with no message
of anv kind from those who had taken
the $50,000.
On Wednesday. April 6, Lindbergh
was prevailed upon to take decisive ac
tion He had Dr. Condon insert the ad
vertisement asking "What Is wrong.
Have you crossed me?” and he furnished
the Treasury with a list of serial num
bers of the ransom bills.
So far the answer to Jafsie's ad has
been complete, poignant silence.
Directions to Yacht Given.
Dr. Condon was handed an envelop
containing explicit directions as to the
baby's whereabouts. It was in the same
handwriting as that of other letters
which played a part in the negotiations
and it matched the writing in the
original ransom note.
The letter instructed Lindbergh to fly
to Cuttyhunk. a small island off the
“elbow'' of Cape Cod and near Marthas
Vineyard. In a certain location along
the shore of Cuttyhunk. carefully de
scribed so there could be no mistake, it
was asserted a 30-foot yacht, with
“Nellie' painted on her bow, would be
found.
On the boat, the letter said, there
were two women in whose care the baby
had been placed. These women, it was
stated, were innocent of any complicity
in the kidnaping, and Lindbergh's word
was asked that they come to no harm.
Lindbergh fully intended to do every
thing in his power to grant that plea.
In the event that anything went
wrong with the plans, however, Lind
bergh wranted a Federal officer avail
able. Several possibilities of a slip-up
had been suggested to him. There was
the possibility the yacht would be
found, with the women aboard, but no
baby there. In this event Lindbergh
would have felt fully justified in hav
ing the women subjected to a grueling
interrogation.
Conflicting Emotions.
The wave of conflicting emotions that
followed reading of the letter of in
I struction can only be imagined by those
j not present. Hope fought and con
' quered the specter of fear that lurked
i in the thoughts of the little coterie
j privileged to be in on events leading
! up to the tragic denouement,
j Lindbergh and Condon returned to
' the latter's home and picked up Reich
i and Breckinridge. Reich drove this
1 group to a place in New York where

! It was now nearing midnight. Reich

coast.
The car halted at a Connecticut port

Then the quartet went to the water

plane that had been flown there for the
purpose. With Linbergh at the con
trols, the plane rose over the Sound and
followed an arllne course northward
to Cuttyhunk.

The sun was just coming up as the

Ominous Silence
Marks Lindbergh
Kidnaping Search
By the Associated Press.
NORFOLK, Va , April 16.—An air of
tenseness, augmented by tight-lipped
silence of the three principals, attended
the work of negotiators here tonight as
another week end, usually productive of
developments, came in their eflorts to
recover the stolen baby of Col. and Mrs.
Charles A Lindbergh.
A silence more strictly adhered to
than at any time during their eflorts to
negotiate with persons they believe to
be the kidnapers served only to add
to expectancy that some move might
be planned to bring an end to their
iengthy eflorts.
I am sorry, but there is nothing w'e
can give out or say at this time," was
the response made by Rear Admiral Guy

today. His associates, John Hughes

declining to discuss when another move
might be expected,
A veil of secrecy on movements or

	<text>Five Jurors Opposed
Death for Hauptmann
Flemington, N. J., Feb. 14.— JPh-
The 12 Hauptmann jurors were unan
imous on their first ballot for oon
viction, it was learned authoritatively
Thursday, but five were opposed, to
the death penalty.
In the five ballots taken, it was
learned, two women were the first to
switch to the death penalty. Robert
Cravatt held out to the end.
The jurors, information disclosed,
. were in virtual agreement when they
* * arrived in their deliberating room on
the sufficiency of the evidence pre
sented against Hauptmann. The on
ly hesitancy among the five, who
wanted life imprisonment, grew out
V of the possibility of error.Hauptmann Gets Death Penalty;

With tears rolling down her
cheeks as her husband went si
lently back to his cell after hear
ing the Jurys verdict of “guilty in

left for me.” As she left the
courtroom by the back door, how
ever, she murmured, “I am not

IntactNew Jersey Death House Awaits Convicted Hauptmann |
■ ■ ■ ■ «
When a prisoner convicted of murder in New Jersey is condemned to death, It Is in this windowless,
fortress-like building in the confines of the state penitentiary at Trenton that he must await execution.
The death cells concealed by the blind walls are almost as austere, nothing being provided that would
enable the prisoner to cheat the grim electric chair pictured at right housed in a small room at the
end of the cell corridor, • vSentenced to Death
Flemington, N. J., Feb. 14.— JT
—Bruno Hauptmann, manacled
and listening to his doom, was
silent.
Bruno Hauptmann went back
to his cell in the Hunterdon coun
ty jail, broke down and wept.
Hearing jury and judge order
him put to death as the killer of
the Lindbergh baby, the Bronx
carpenter spoke only to comfort
his wife.BRUNO RICHARD HAUPTMANN
“Its all right. Annie," he said.
But in the loneliness, the
pseudo-privacy of prison which
has been his lot for five months,
he mumbled unintelligible Ger
man phrases.
Under state law, he will be held
here at least until 11 p. m., Fri
day. Then, 48 hours, having ex
pired since the warrant for his
removal was issued, he may be
taken to the death house at Tren
ton.
Not until Hauptmann is takenThe $14,000 ransom eaehe found U
Hauptmann's garage belongs to Col*
onel Lindbergh, who paid $50,000 ran
som. He is not likely to get it back
until the state is positive it will no|
need it as evidence in a new trial.
Prison precedent combined with'
judge and jury to fix the night of
March 22 as the tentative for
Hauptmann's electrocution.
He was sentenced to “suffer death”
the week of March 18. and Friday is
doomsday in the death house at Tren
ton.
Edward J. Reilly said an appeal
would be carried to the United States
supreme court if necessary.
The first tribunal expected to hear
the plea, the state court of errors and
appeals, meets for its next term late
in May. The court of pardons will
not hear it before October.
The Jurors who sentenced him
showed more emotion than did
Hauptmann as he stood before them
at 10:45 p. m. Wednesday.
With a look of affection, the 36-
year-old prisoner turned to his faith
ful wife and said:
“It's all right, Annie.”
Back in his cell, out of the gaze of
the curious, Hauptmann burst into
tears.
The jurors required more than 11
hours to reach their verdict. They
were closely guarded after the case
ended, but a courthouse report was
that two of the women had held out
for a recommendation of mercy. That
would have meant a life sentence.
There was no mention of mercy
when the jury was polled.
With stuttering words Foreman
Charles Walton, Sr., announced the
verdict. He who had listened to the
evidence for more than six weeks
even twisted the defendants name in
his fight to remain calm.
“Guilty,” he announced. “We finq
the defendant, Richard Bruno Haupt
mann, guilty of murder in the first
degree.”
An insignificant piece of paper
rustled in his trembling hands. He
glanced at the paper with unseeing
eyes in pretense of consulting it.
A few strides away stood Haupt
mann, jaw set, face so pale and hag
gard it was ghastly in the electric
light. Sharply erect, he tottered
slightly as he heard the foremans
words.
Jadga Imposes Sentence
A few minutes later Justice Thomas
W. Trenchard quietly imposed sen
tence.
0o ended the long Lindbergh kid
nap trail. It began In Fsatharbed
Lane, Hopewell, the night of March
1, 1932, when the wind was bowling
over the lonely Sourland Mountain
on which OoL Charles A. Lindbergh
made his home. It ended in a prosaic,
rural courtroom Uttered with papers
and clgaret stubs.
Thirteen times the death dealing
verdict was recited, on the thirteenth
day of the month.
After Walton had made known the
decision, the court dark sated:
“Members of ~w jury, you have
heard the verdict, that you find tew
defendant. Bruno Richard Haupt
mann, guilty of murder in tew first
degree, and so say you anr*
“We do."

BE DENIED BY POLICE
HOPEWELL, April 9. — Henry
“Red” Johnson, sailor sweetheart
of Betty Gow, the Lindbergh nurse,
was turned over to the Federal au
thorities today for possible depor
tation, thus ending his possible
connection with the kidnapping of
Charles A. Lindbergh, Jr,
I Every development of the day at
Hopewell was negative, according
to police bulletins, and the usual
crop of rumors that the baby has
been returned were once more de
nied.
An air of expectancy or a “just
wait” attitude prevailed at the
Lindbergh home Friday. Two per
sons visited the Lindbergh home,
one of whom looked like a banker
and the other a nautical looking
person. Rumors had it that the
banker came to arrange for the
turning over of ransom money to
the nautical looking person who in
turn will turn it over to the ab
ductors. There was no confirma
tion of this rumor, however.</text>

SMS IINDSERCN
HOPEWELL, N. J., April 27.—Col
onel Charles A. Lindbergh Tuesday
issued a statement from his estate
near here, saying he was not in
terested in the overtures made by
A1 Capone, gang leader who is in
a Chicago prison, regarding his
voluntary expressions to aid in re
turning the kidnapped child back
to his mothers arms.
Colonel Lindbergh said it was his
opinion that Capone had no real
knowledge about the^kidnapping of
the child and that he did not know
the present whereabouts of the
child.
This stand on the part of Lind
bergh is taken to indicate that his
own negotiations, and through his
Norfolk intermediaries, are pro
gressing satisfactorily and that im
portant developments can be look
ed for at any time.
A good deal of the ransom money
I which was paid to the kidnappers
has already turned up in New York
and other cities but no special ef
fort is being made to trace it.
