      <time>1959 : Clay wins National Golden Gloves light heavyweight championship, beating Tony Madison.<time>
	<text>LOUISVILLE CUTIE WINS TOP HONORS IN GOLDEN GLOVES
  A cheering
crowd of 11.159 fans who attended
the 33rd annual Tournament of
Champions Golden Gloves copeti
tion in the Chicago Stadium last
Wednesday night may well have
watched a future world champion.
He is 18-year-old Cassius Clay,
a boxing cutie from Louisville,
who won top honors during the
tournament by defeating Jimmy
Jones of Chicago for the heavy
weight crown. Jones was the de
fending champ.
Clay, who was also the 1959
light heavyweight champion, mov
ed up into the heavier division with
ease with a masterful exhibition of
boxing skill.
In their bout, televised nation
wide along with three others on
the card. Clay jabbed, shifted out
of range, countered and generally
outboxed Jones, whose knockout
punch was held a big threat for
his opponent.
Boxed I.ike Veteran
In fact. Clay boxed so well that
there were those at ringside who
thought he could start out right
now as a winning pro. He fought
so much like a veteran Incident
ally. Cassius younger brother was
eliminated earlier in the tourna
ment in a bid for the light heavy
weight crown.
Sharing championship honors
with Clay was another talented
tan fighter, Jefferson Davis of
Nashville. Dans, an all-out clouter.
defeated Bill Joiner of Cincinnati
in an action-packed three rounder,
that was also televised.
In winning his bout on decision.
Clay used a stabbing left jab and
follow-up right to beat Jones.
Davis lashed out with savage
rights and lefts to halt his man
after Joiner had given him sev
eral unpleasant moments in the
first round.
Clay and Davis were the only
two champions among the eight
crowned Wednesday night. But
they left no doubt that they were just about the best of the number.

	<text>CASSIUS HUMAN AFTER ALL, NARROW DECISION PROVES
The black
Caddy pulled up to the entrance of the
Miami Beach Auditorium nearly two hours
before the closed-circuit telecast of the
Cassius Clay-Doug Jones fight In New York
was to begin. 
Cassius Clay bounces a left off the contorted
chin of Doug Jones in the 10th round of their
heavyweight fight last night in Madison
Square! Garden. It was this round which
Cassius Human After All,
Narrow Decision Proves
NEW YORK Mat 14
Clay balloon has been punc
tated. The self proclaimed
“greatest heavyweight” is hu
man after all.
There were no knockouts, no
knockdowns, no "total annlhi-
latlon,” and brash Cassius was
lucky to get a thin, lustily
booed decision in 10 rounds
over hard-working Doug Jones
of New York at Madison Square
Garden last night.
At times Clay looked like a
novice both at long range and
inside. His bombs didnt explode
and he had to rally furiously
in the final two rounds to get
the unanimous verdict.
"Clay showed me that Ill get
locked up for murder if were
ever matched," was the com
ment of Liston, who saw the
igored circuit telecast in Miami
beach.

	<text>WANT CASSIUS TO FIGHT IN ITALY
Cassius Clay of Louisville was of
fered $80,000 Monday to come to
Rome and meet Italys all-con
quering Franco DePiccoli in a
I battle of Olympic champions.
“Let Clay come to Italy,” said
the 26-year-old DePiccoli. “Frank
ly, I dont think he'll last three
rounds.”
The husky Italiain won the
Olympic heavyweight crown while
Clay took the light heavyweight
title in the 1960 games in Rome.
Since the Olympics Clay has
won all 8 of his pro fights and
is the No. 2 ranking heavyweight
contender. DePiccoli, a left-hand
er, is undefeated in 21 fights. He
is ranked 10th.
Rino Tommasi, the Italians
manager, said he made the offer
to Clay through Dewey Fragetta,
the internatinal boxing agent in
New York.
“I dont consider Clay a top
fighter,” said DePiccoli. “I saw
him at the Olympics and I wasnt
the least impressed. He may be a
better boxer than I am but I am
stronger.
“Of course I can make mis
takes. But I dont think Signor
Clay is unbeatable.”

	<text>CASSIUS BROUGHT BACK BOXING TO LIFE
CLAY is a handsome youngster
who said he will ot be satisfied
until he becomes the -richest of
all heavyweight champions.
When the referee raised Cassius
Clays arm. in victory at the end
of his fight with Doug Jones, the
18,000 fans at Madison Square
Garden. demonstrated their dis
approval by bombarding the ring
with peanuts, programs, cups and
sssorted garbage.
The winning pitcher was E.
Hendricks. C. Asencio got the loss.
thats all that counts.
Not surprisingly, Clays bitter
est critics were the same ones
who had been most lavish in their
praise for him. They felt that
Clay had conned them played
them for chumps.
In away, they are correct. But,
on the other hand, they got just
what they deserved. After all,
they were the ones who pro
claimed Cassius Clay as some kind
of a superman after he had
knocked out a few mediocre fight
ers. More reserved writers took
a “wait and see” attitude about
Clay.
What his enemies seem to over
look is the fact that boxing is a
business. Something that young
Cassius Clay keeps in mind at all
times.
Everyone is always eomplain
ing about the sad state of box
ing. The turnout even for cham
pionship bout is low. People
just seem to have lost interest
in boxing.
Cassius Clay, by himself, 're
vived that interest. People turned
out to see him fight. Everyone
wanted to get a look at the loud-
mouth. Most of them wanted to
see him get a beating. But Clay
didnt care about that. As long as
they showed up, he drew the
money.

	<text>CLAY CALLS SHOT AGAIN IN BLOODY BOUT
Henry Cooper connects with a long right to the
jaw of Cassius Clay in one of many exchanges
during their heavyweight bout in London last
night. Coopers left eye already is bloody from
a cut opened in the third round. Although 
down in the fourth, Clay stopped the British heavyweight 
in the fifth to make another of his prophecies come true.
Cassius Marcellus Clay, the
punching prophet, beat Brit
ains Henry Cooper in the pre
dicted fifth round last night
and silenced a horrified crowd
in the fight that Liz Taylor

	<text>PATTERSON FIGHT TAKES LITTLE LONGER THAN FIRST MATCH
LAS VEGAS. Nev. UPI—With
Floyd Patterson now demolished
as a challenger, heavyweight
champion Sonny Liston turned his
attention today to zipping the lip
of young Cassius Clay in a $7
million title fight at Philadel
phias Municipal Stadium, Sept.
30.
Big Sonny, whose ham-like fists
floored ex-champion Patterson
three times for a knockout at
2:10 of the first round Monday
night, will formally sign at Phila
delphia on Friday for his second
defense against cocky young Clay
of Kentucky, it was learned au
thoritatively today.
Thus will Liston make good on
a promise or was it a threat—
he made months ago when he
told Clay, “Youre next, loud,
mouth.”
Brash Cassius and glowering
Sonny will do their pen wielding
at Philadelphia at 2 p.m. EDT
Friday.
28th Straight Win
Sonny, who registered his 28th
straight victory and 23rd knock
out before a sellout 7,816 at the
Las Vegas Convention Center,
will receive 40 per cent of net
receipts from the Philadelphia,
fight. Clay has agreed to take
22* dcp cent
Patterson, who announced he'
will not retire despite two first j
round knockouts in his latest two
ring appearances, admitted he's
out of the title picture right now.
Surprisingly he added that he
gives Clay a chance to beat Son
ny in September because of
Clays youth, speed, weight
about 210 pounds, and punch.
Bob Nilon, president of Inter
continental Promotions, Inc., ad
mitted today that Liston and Clay
already have come to terms and
that they will be in Philadelphia
Friday afternoon for a “news
conference.”

    <text>Cassius Clay Puts
In Unexpected Appearance
At Listons Victory Party
LAS VEGAS, Ncv. UFI — “This,”
—announced lippy Cassius Clay,
“was not a heavyweight champion
ship fight. It was just an elimina
tion to see whos going to fight
me.”
Clay, the noisy, unbeaten con
tender from Louisville, made the
remark after putting in an un
expected appearance at Sonny
Listons victory party Monday
night, following the champions
one-round knockout of Floyd
Patterson.
Clay said he showed up at the
victory celebration “just to make
him Liston mad.”
He shouldered his way through
the crowd to where Liston was
sitting with some friends and told
the massive champion: “Youre
just a sucker. My brother could
nave beaten Floyd Patterson.”
Liston, in a rare burst of humor,
invited:
“Come over here and sit on my
knee and finish your oragne juice.”
Some further words were ex
changed and at one point Liston
rose to his feet and assumed a
mock fighting pose. Friends moved
between them.
Clay stole much of the thunder
from the fight even before it start
ed.
Clay stepped into the ring while
the announcer was introducing
famous boxers who were at ring
side. The fistic poet waved to
the crowd and shook hands with
Patterson.
Then he started for Liston with
his hand out — but suddenly re
treated in mock fear and bolted
from the ring.
