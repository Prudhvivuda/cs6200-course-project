      <text>The Sixteenth Amendment
        The Constitution of the Unit
        ed StAtfls was mimnsplv maAo Aif
        icultj to amend. Madison, the
        'Father of the Constitution,' was
        against ''innovation' and Hamil-'
        ton' feared the turbulent, chan-'
        ging people. So the Constitution'
        was made unchangeable except b.
        a vote of two-thirds of Congress,
        and three-fourths of the State
        Legislatures or State Conventions.
        One-forty-fourth df the voters to- j
        day, if prperly placoed, can block'
        any amendment. Of the four,
        hundred and thirty-five amend-'
        wents proposed from 1889 to 1904'
        noi one was aaopteu. it is tne
        belief of many people that the;
        Constitution can never be amend-'
        ed. I
        "We, on 'the other hand, believe
        Amendment permiting the income1
        tax, is possible, probable, inevita-'
        cle. The- resolution was. -unani-j
        mously adopted by the Senate,
        and. almost unanimously by the
        House. Thirty-five of the forty
        six States must ratify, but thirty-five
        States will be found. The
        South is for it; the west is for
        it; the real people of the East
        are for it; the two parties have
        declared in. its favor and Presi
        dent Taft has taken his stand on
        it. It is more than the mere
        question of an income tax, al
        though that is important. It is a
        question of national sovereignty,
        of the right of ninety millions of
        petTple to tax. themselves as they
        deem just and expedient. It is
        an issue upon which in times of
        danger the national welfare, ev
        en the national existence, might
        depend. The Sixteenth Amend
        ment nnist and will be adopted.
        But it will not be adopted by
        the people staying at. home and
        wishing for it. It must be made
        an issue in every 'State, in every
        assembly district. Time fights
        on the side of the Sixteenth
        Amendment; there is no limit.
        Once a State adopts it, the rati
        fication lasts' forever. But if
        the ratification is not made the
        first session, H may be again pro-,
        posed for 'the second, third,
        tenth, or ninety-ninth time. If iwe
        do not suceed at first,, we can
        j try, try again.
        I The Sixteenth Amendment
        must be ratfiied, not only to en
        able pur Government in times of
        peace and war to impose equita-.
        ble taxes, but also to place the
        fundamental law of the land,
        where it should be placed in the
        hands of an intelligent, tolerant,
        and liberty-loving, people.</text>

      <text>Sixteenth Amendment.
        Washington. Feb. 3.—The provi
        sion authorizing an income tax as now
        i?nnen.?nP£rtknown
        .of
        the federal
        constitu­
        tion will be as the "Sixteenth
        Amendment" and reads as follows:
        Article XVI.—The congress shall
        have power to lay and collect taxes on
        incomes, from whatever source de-
        w'",ou'
        apportionment among
        the states, and without regard to any
        census or enumeration."
        The change in the fundamental la'V
        or the land marks a new epoch in the
        American tax system. For the first,
        time congress is given specific authori
        ty by a provision of the federal con
        stitution to levy an income tax. All
        previous efforts for a tax of this kind
        have been without the explicit author
        ity of a constitutional provision. Tho
        change also marks a broad develop
        ment of the economic and fiscal s.vs
        torn of the a basis for taxation, simi
        lar to the systems now in force in
        Great Britain, Austria, Switzerland,
        Spain and various other countries.
        New Source of Revenue.
        Probably the most important aspect
        of an income tax. as now authorized
        by the constitution, is that it adds a
        new source of revenue for the govern
        ment. At present the two great
        sources of government revenue aro
        customs duties levied by tariff acts on
        goods imported from foreign coun
        tries and internal revenue taxes on
        tobacco, spirits, olemargarlne and cer
        tain other articles. Each of these
        sources at present produces a little
        less than half of the total revenues
        of the government. In 1911 the total
        government revenues were $700,100,
        906 and of this customs duties yielded
        $11.3,846,269, while internal revenue'
        taxes yielded $331,759,375. The re
        mainder came from sales of public
        lands, the corporation tax and various
        miscellaneous sources. Under an in
        come tax, however, a new and far
        reaching source of revenue ls provid
        ed for the government, and this will
        in turn reduce the amounts required
        rfom the other sources of revenue,'
        customs and internal revenue, in or
        der to meet the expenses of govern
        ment. This last phase is likely to have
        an important bearing on tariff legis
        lation as hereafter enacted.
        Before the amendment formally be
        comes a part of the constitution to.
        day's action of the legislature must be
        transmitted to the secretary of state
        at Washington and proclamation of
        the ratification made.
        First Step In 1909.
        The first official step toward amend
        ing the constitution so as to authorise
        specifically an income tax was taken
        by the senate on July 7. 1909. By
        unanimous vote, that body adopted a
        resolution, submitting this amend
        ment to the legislatures of the respec
        tive states. Only a few days later, on
        July 12, the house passed the resolu
        tion by a vote of 317 to 14.</text>

      <time>February 3, 1913: Wyoming becomes the last of the three-fourths states needed to ratify the Sixteenth Amendment, which officially enables Congress to legally act on a permanent income tax.</time>
      <text>Here is the
        Sixteenth Amendment to the Con
        stitution of the United States, rati
        fied Monday:
        "Article XVI. The Congress shall
        have power to lay and collect taxes
        on incomes, from whatever source
        derived, with ou t apportionment
        among the several States, and with
        out regard to any census or enumer
        a'ion." Wyoming had the honor of mak
        ing the amendment effective. With
        in two hours after word was received
        that the Wyoming Legislature had
        ratified the amendment, a telegram
        was received by Senator RichardHon,
        of Delaware, Btating that his State
        had also ratified the amendment,
        and to this was added New Mexico,
        making thirty-eight States to act
        favorably, Utah and New Jersey
        are expected to do the same. Only
        thirty-six were needed.
        The Democrats tariff makers of
        the House and Senate forthwith an
        nounced that thby would begin pre
        parations at once to enact an income
        tax law a3 a part of the Democratic
        tariff programme at the coming ex

        Simmons, of North Carolina, who
        will probably be the next chairman
        of the Finance Committee, spoke
        for the Senate. Representative Hull,
        of Tennessee, the income tax expert
        of the Ways and Means Committee.
        spoke for the House.
        Senator Norris Brown, of Nebras
        ka, Republican, author of the
        amendment, which he introduced in
        the Senate on June 17, 1909, with
        pardonable pride, announced to the
        Senate during the afternoon that
        three-fourths of the sovereign States
        had ratified it. He congratulated
        the Senate and the country on the
        result. The amendment will not be
        come actually a part of the Constitu
        tion until the notice of the ratifi
        cation by Wyoming or Delaware has
        been formally filed with the Senator
        of StatP, which will doubtless be
        within a few days.
        The Democrats propose to raise
        approximately $100,000,000 a year
        by the new tax and to graduate it
        so that persons of great wealth will
        pay at a higher rate.</text>

      <text>The Sixteenth Amendment.
        The Sixteenth Amendment to the constitution of the United
        States has been ratified by the legislatures of thirty eight states,
        two more than the required three-fourths. It gives Congress the
        power "to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source
        derived, without apportionment among the several states, and with
        out regard to any census or enumeration."
        Congress having been given this power what is its duty We
        believe that it should at once proceed to pass an income tax law,
        Some argue that no such duty devolves upon Congress that the
        amendment simply gives congress the power to act but that it does
        not follow that it should act at once as present conditions do not
        demand such action and the provision is solely for the purpose of
        giving congress the power to pass a law when the necessity shall
        arise.
        As viewed in the light of history, is this argument good We
        think not. The Sixteenth Amendment is the only amendment to
        the constitution in forty three years. In 1893 Congress passed an
        income tax law which the Supreme Court held unconstitutional.
        For this reason those favoring an income tax law proposed amend
        ing the constitution. Finally in 1909 both houses of Congress by a
        three-fourths vote passed the proposed amendment and now three
        fourths of the states by their legislatures have ratified it.
        Since a few years after the close of the Civil War, there has been
        practically as much need for an income tax at one time as another.
        The members of Congress believed that the people wanted this law
        or- they never would have passed the amendment, as most of them
        were voting to impose a tax upon their own incomes. The members
        of the state legislatures that ratified it also thought that the people
        wanted it or they would not have voted for it, because it is not the
        type of measure that is passed by a legislature against the wishes
        of the people.
        The people believe that an income tax is fair and just and Con
        gress should pass one at once. We can see no reason why one
        should not be passed. It is only right that the people who are re
        ceiving the largest benefits from government should pay for keep
        ing it up that those who can best afford to pay for maintaining the
        government should do so. A person's income is the best gauge of
        his ability to pay. An income tax it is hoped and believed will take
        some of the burden of the support and maintenance of the govern
        ment off of the shoulders of the poor and put it on the shoulders of
        the rich, where we believe it belongs.
        But it's opponents says that it will make a nation of liars. If
        a man will lie about his income to prevent paying a tax on it, he is
        already lying about how much property he has to prevent paying a
        tax on it. It is not making a liar out of him, because he was already
        one.
        It's opponents also say that it will be unjust, as incomes derived
        from certain sources are much more definitely determined than
        from others that the man on a salary will almost certainly pay</text>

        AGAIN ATTACKED.
        Washington, Sept. 23. Counsel
        for Union Pacific Railroad stock
        holders and others have filed a brief
        in the Supreme Court attacking as
        unconstitutional the income tax
        provisions of the Underwood-Simmons
        tariff law.
        The attorneys contend that while
        the sixteenth amendment empowers
        congress to impose a tax on "incomes
        from whatever source derived," the
        framers of the law stretched it to
        cover many taxes other than on in
        come. It is asserted, too, that there is no
        constitutional authority for taxing a
        specific class of persons, unmarried
        men, more than others, or for the
        super-tax imposed upon men with
        incomes over $20,000.</text>

        Constitution provides: "The Congress
        shall have power to lay and collect
        taxes on incomes, from whatever
        Source derived, without apportionment
        .among the several states, and with-,
        out regard to any census or enumera
        tion."
        The statute specifically imposes &
        tax upon net income which "shall in
        clude gains, profits, and income de
        rived from sales or dealing in proper
        ty," and then provides: "(c) For the
        purpose of ascertaining the gain de
        rived from the sale or other disposi
        tion of property, real, personal, or
        mixed, acquired before March 1, 1913,
        "the fair market price or value of such
        •property as of March 1, 1913, shall
        be the basis for determining the am
        ount of such gain derived."
        It is the contention of the plaintiff
        that the statute is unconstitutional
        -an so far as it taxes as income the
        increased value of investments.when
        J-ealized by sale, and that such a tax
        is a direct tax upon capital or property
        not authorized by the Sixteenth
        Amendment and not a tax upon in
        come. In other words, that such gains
        do not come within the definition of
        Income as the word is used in the Six
        teenth Amendment.
        On the other hand, it is the conten
        tion of the Government that sueh
        gains do constitute income properly
        taxable under the Income Tax Law of
        1916.
        We are therefore brought to a con
        sideration of the scope of the Six
        teenth Amendment, because there is no
        question but that prior to the adop
        tion of this Amendment the Congress
        had no power to tax as income gains
        arising^ from the sale of property
        where the owner thereof was not a
        dealer or trader in such property so
        as to justify an excise tax upon his
        business.</text>

      <text>The Sixteenth Amendment.
        The Sixteenth Amendment to the constitution of the United
        States has been ratified by the legislatures of thirty eight states,
        two more than the required three-fourths. It gives Congress the
        power "to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source
        derived, without apportionment among the several states, and with
        out regard to any census or enumeration."
        Congress having been given this power what is its duty ? We
        believe that it should at once proceed to pass an income tax law,
        Some argue that no such duty devolves upon Congress ; that the
        amendment simply gives congress the power to act but that it does
        not follow that it should act at once as present conditions do not
        demand such action and the provision is solely for the purpose of
        giving congress the power to pass a law when the necessity shall
        arise.
        As viewed in the light of history, is this argument good ? We
        think not. The Sixteenth Amendment is the only amendment to
        the constitution in forty three years. In 1893 Congress passed an
        income tax law which the Supreme Court held unconstitutional.
        For this reason those favoring an income tax law proposed amend
        ing the constitution. Finally in 1909 both houses of Congress by a
        three-fourths vote passed the proposed amendment and now three
        fourths of the states by their legislatures have ratified it.
        Since a few years after the close of the Civil War, there has been
        practically as much need for an income tax at one time as another.
        The members of Congress believed that the people wanted this law
        or- they never would have passed the amendment, as most of them
        were voting to impose a tax upon their own incomes. The members
        of the state legislatures that ratified it also thought that the people
        wanted it or they would not have voted for it, because it is not the
        type of measure that is passed by a legislature against the wishes
        of the people.
        The people believe that an income tax is fair and just and Con
        gress should pass one at once. We can see no reason why one
        should not be passed. It is only right that the people who are re
        ceiving the largest benefits from government should pay for keep
        ing it up ; that those who can best afford to pay for maintaining the
        government should do so. A person's income is the best gauge of
        his ability to pay. An income tax it is hoped and believed will take
        some of the burden of the support and maintenance of the govern
        ment off of the shoulders of the poor and put it on the shoulders of
        the rich, where we believe it belongs.But it's opponents says that it will make a nation of liars. If
        a man will lie about his income to prevent paying a tax on it, he is
        already lying about how much property he has to prevent paying a
        tax on it. It is not making a liar out of him, because he was already
        one.
        It's opponents also say that it will be unjust, as incomes derived
        from certain sources are much more definitely determined than
        from others : that the man on a salary will almost certainly pay</text>
