Women Have
Right to Vote
Tennessee's Ratification
Gives 9,500,000 More
Right to Vote for Next
President in the Fall
Fight Begun in 1848
Campaign Opened in Seneca
Falls Started Movement
Which Enveloped World
Woman suffrage was won for the
women of all the states in the Union
when Tennessee, th'e thirty-sixth state,
ratified the Federal amendment. Ap?
proximately 27,000,000 women will be
entitled to vote in the Presidential
election this fall. State suffrage al?
ready ha^l enfranchised 17.500,000, and
ratification adds to this number 9,500,
000.
Thii marks the end of the women's
campaign for the ballot which began
obscurely in a little meeting in Seneca
Falls, N. Y., in 1848, swept across this
country, and extendea the political
freedom of women to nearly every
other nation in the civilized world.
Fifteen states in the United States
already had conferred full franchise
rights on women, and in fifteen others
women were entitled to vote for Presi?
dent and for certain municipal offices,
but not for members of Congress.
The suffrage amendment resolution
was passed by the Congress on June 4,
19li). Its wording was that of the orig?
inal Susan B. Anthony amendments,
drawn up by the pioneer suffragist soon
after the Civil War had enfranchised
the colored people and following the
form of the Fifteenth Amendment. It
reads:
"The right of citizens of the United
States to vote shall not be denied or
abridged by the United States or by
any state' on account of sex.
"Congress shall have power by ap?
propriate legislation to enforce the
provisions of this article."

Special Sessions Called
The fact that many state legislatures
did not hold regular sessions in 1920,
and would be required to call special
sessions if the .suffrage amendment
were to become effective in time f?ir
the Presidential elections, was the last
great obstacle the suffrage movement
had to overcome. Even in states
where the women had voted for I
many years and where ratification was
more or less an accepted fact the Gov?
ernors hesitated to call special ses-
sions, for reasons of economy, or be?
cause of local political issues which
threatened to become embarrassing.

FINDS WATERY GRAVE ON FIRST TRIP.
OVER 1,400 PEOPLE ARE DROWNED
WHITE STAR LINER STRIKES AN ICEBERG, WHILE
GOING AT FULL SPEED AT 1:25 MONDAY
MORNING AND GOES DOWN IN
LESS THAN AN HOUR.
WOMEN AND CHILDREN WERE SAVED
But Many Wealthy and Prominent M en Are Lost.The White
Star liner Titanic, the world's great
est steamship has gono down some 500
miles off Cape Race, with 630 of her
1,300 passengers and her full crew of
860 men on board. That the greatest
catastrophe in marine history has oc
curred to a vessel of their line is ad
mitted by the oflicials of the White
Star Steamship company In New York
The liner Carpathia, the first vessel to
come within sight of the Titanic, res
cued all the Titanic's life boats in
which were 670 persons most of them

women and children. Many women
and children, however, have perished.
When the Carpathia reached the ill
fated vessel no sign of life was to ho
seen anywhere, the mountainous ocean
swells giving much evidence to the
stupendous disaster. Early reports
stated that all the passengers and the
crew of the Titanic had been taken
off by the Allen liner's Virginian and
the Parisian, and the Carpathia, but
wireless message received here dis
credit these reports in every detail
No hope is held out at the offices or
the White Star line that, any man on
board has survived fo tell the story of
the final sinking of the levithian, al
though some of the women in the
boats may have witnessed the sinking.
Only by miracle, it is pointed out,
could any person who stood by the
ship escape the great vessel's power
ful suction as she sank to the bottom.
The Titanic carried the most notable
list of passengers ever borne across the
Atlantic by one vessel. Homecoming
American tourist postponed their sail
ing weeks ago so as to ride the new
wonder of the season on her maiden
voyage.
Dispatches state that the Titanic
went down at 2:20 o'clock Monday
morning. The delay in the transmis
sion of the news is attributed to the
fact that all dispatches have been sub
ject to difficult relays.
The collision of the Titanic with an
Iceberg is now known to have been
a lieadon crash that occurred while
the liner was proceeding little less

than her best speed. She was a day
ahead of her schedule and it is con
sidered probable that an attempt to
make a record-breaking voyage was
the hope of her crew when she entered
the ice field.
Her forward plates were completely
wrecked. A gaping wound opening
below her water line and letting the
water into her forward compartments.
In the meantime the lifeboats were
manned and into them were placed
as many of the women and chil
dren as they could hold. The
boats were put off while there was
yet some hope of saving the Titanic
afloat until wireless could summon
help. Later and more conservative es
timates tell of great bravery on the
part of the men passengers. There
was a minimum of disorder. John
Jacob Astor. who, with his bride, was
returning from their long honeymoon
abroad, saw his bride placed in a life
boat safely away. Col. Astor was
drowned. The work of getting the life
boats away, the work of allaying
the fears of the great crowd of pas
sengers as much as possible, the
work of keeping the pumps in opera
tion and the engines throbbing—these
tasks and countless others were direct
ed by Captain Smith, the vener
able commander of the Titanic, and
before her advent the commander of J
the Olympic who displayed almost su
perhuman power of mind and body at
the world's most horrible sea disaster, I
crowned his long and honorable serv. j
ice on the high seas.
A wireless message from the Vir- |
ginia states that the occupants of the
small boats which she picked up have •
been transferred to the Carpathia
which is proceeding to New York.
The Titanic struck the iceberg at
1:26 Sunday night and floundered at
2:20 Monday morning.
At daybreak the Carpathia arrived
on the scene and her passengers and
crew brought the small boats with
their precious human cargo into New
York.
The boats which rushed to the Ti
tanic's aid found only the scattered
life boats and a dismal scene of wreck

Official Statement.
White Star line had received no word
here at 8 o'clock other than from the
press dispatches of the reported acci
dent to the Titanic.
They were unable to understand
why thev had not received some dis-
f latches from the Titanic. The follow
ng statement was made by one of the
Officers:
"Twelve hours have passed since the
collision was reported to have taken
place and we have heard nothing of
the a- ident. It is most strange the
Titanic's sister ship, Olympic, which
has a wireless apparatus of sufficient
strength to send a message across the
Atlantic, has sent us nothing. The
Olvmpic left here last Saturday and
this morning is 360 miles away from
the Titanic. The Olympic should be
alongside the Titanic at 2 o'clock this
afternoon. The Olympic has been no
tified of the reported accident."
A wireless message from the Titanic
received shortly after midnight an
nounced the liner had struck an ice
berg off the banks of Newfoundland
and was in a sinking condition. Trans
fer of the passengers to the life boats
began at once. The accident occurred
at 10:25 o'clock last night. Two hours
later the ship's wireless apparatus,
which had been working so badly as
to permit of only intermittent and
fragmentary messages, failed com
pletely. The last words sent by the operatoi
told that the vessel was apparently
doomed, "sinking by the head" anl
that the women passengers were be
ing rushed into the lifeboats. A reas
curing feature was that the weather
was calm and clear, and help only a
few hours away.
First S. O, S. Message.
The Titanic's fii.st S. O. S. message
was received by he Allan liner Vir
ginian which, according to the posi
tion given by thi Titamic's operator
was not more than 170 miles away. The
captain of the Vi-inlan at once start-
ed his boat at full speed for the scene
of the disaster announcing to his broth
er officer on the bridge of the Titanic
that the Virginian should reach him
by 10 o'clock this morning. The Titan
Ic's accident happened in latitude 41 -4d
north, longitude 50 .14 west. This point
is about 1,150 miles due east of New
York city and 450 miles south of Cape
Race. Newfoundland, wireless station.
All the messages from the ship were
relayed to the Cape Race wireless sta
tion by the Virginia and forwarded
by the Marconi company to New York
city. The Titanic's twin ship, Olympic,
which left New York last week, wa3
also in direct communication with tne
sinking boat from a point 300 miles
away and started at once for the scene.
The Titanic, which is on her maiden
trip is in charge of Captain Smith,
who was on the bridge of the big
Olympic when that boat collided with
the British cruiser Hawke last Sep
tember. The Titanic carries 1,470 pas
sengers, of whom 318 are in the first
cabin and 262 in the second cabin.
Notable Passenger List.
The passenger list is a notable one
including Mr. and Mrs. John Jacob

Steamship men here today character
ized the disaster as "the most start
ling news which has come in from the
s-ea since the advent of wireless teleg
raphy." The firet heard of the accident was
about 1 o'clock this morning when 8
bulletin from Montreal stated that the
Allan line offices there had received a
wireless from Captain Gambell of the
steamer Virginian, stating that the
Titanic was calling for assistance af
ter a. collision with -as iceberg. The

position was said to be about 350 miles

"The Olympic at midnight was in

steamship Baltic also reported herself
as about 200 miles east of the Titanic,

and a crew of 860 men. A large per
centage, if not the majority of the
passengers are Americans. The news
paper offices were besieged early to-
i day bv inquiries from hundreds of
persons shocked by the fragmentary
newspaper dispatches seen at the
breakfast table but in the early morn
ing hours there was nothing vital to
add to the alarming reports from
Cape Race. Something further was
expected every moment, but there was
nothing at hand to relieve the anxiety
fhown in every quarter. Vice Presi
dent P. A. S. Franklin of the Interna
tional Merchant Marine, the highest
official of the White Star line here,
was one of the first to be notified of
the reported disaster but it was only
through the Associated Press that he
learned of it, and for hours there
after he could only experess his as
tonishment at the news and his doubt
that such a large and thoroughly pro
tected ship as the Titanic could be in
danger at sea.
l-rpon hearing the first reports he
spoke reassuringly, saying that only
eight or ten hours before the White
Star offices had received a wireless giv
ing the liner's position. He was sure if
she had met with any accident he
would have heard from her promptly.
"We are absolutely satisfied even if
she was in collision with an iceberg
she Is in no danger," he said.</text>
