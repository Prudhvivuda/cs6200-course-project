Washington, Sept. 2. The senate late today rejected the
Underwood amendment to the Adamson bill which would give 'H
the Interstate Commerce Commission authority to fix rail- 'H
road wages and hours of service. The vote was 14 to 57.
The senate also rejected Senator Newlands' amendment to
make interference with the operation of trains a misdemeanor
punishable by fine and imprisonment. Senator Thomas with
drew a similar amendment. The vote on the Newlands
amendment was 14 to 52.
Washington, Sept. 2.- The Adamson eight-hour bill, ac
cepted by labor union officials as providing a satisfactory set
tlement of the demands on which they base their order calling
a nation-wide railroad strike for Monday, was passed without
amendment by the senate tonight and now awaits only Presi
dent Wilson's signature to make it a law. Revocation of the IH
strike order is expected within a few hours. 11
The Brotherhood men have called off the strike.
Washington. Sept 2. At a meeting
of the 13 brotherhood officials in
Washington today it was formally de
cided that cancellation of the strike
order should not be sent out until
President Wilson actually has signed
the etght-hour bill. Another meeting
of the officials will be field tonight
after the senate has acted on the
house bill.
At this time there is a possibility
that the decision might be changed.
Washington, Sept 2. The enact
ment into law of enough of President
Wilson's program to prevent the rail
way strike seemed reassured when
congress reasembled this morning ot
10 o'clock with a program that calls
for a vote not later than 6 o'clock
this evening. It was the belief of ad
ministration leaders that the Adamson
bill as it passed the house late yester
day, approved by President Wilson
and formally accepted by the labor
leaders as meeting their demands,
would eventually be accepted by the
senate, thus obviating a conference to
reconcile differences was possible.
As soon as the perfected bill finally
is passed a special messenger will
carry it to tho summer White House
at Shadow Lawn so the president may
sign it at once and end the menace of
a general paralysis of the country's
transportation lines at 7 o'clock Mon

positive assurauce that there would I'e no r.iilroad strike Monday. They
declared the Senate certainly would pass th: Adamson bill. Nothing can
block It, they said, and so telegraphed President Wilson at Shadow Lawn
before the debate in the Senate began. Final voting on the bill will begin

Although Senate leaders practically
agreed to pass tho measure adopted
by the House there was spirited de
bate. Tho first amendment proposed to
day came from Benator Shafrotb,
Democrat, ll'i proposed to fix Sen
ator Underwood's uincndment em
powering the Interstate Commerce
Commission to inako wage schedules
so that no employee would be com
pelled to work for tho rate prescribed.
Senator Bhafrnth opened the debate
by moving to chuuge Henator Under
wood's amendment so that It would be
specifically stated no employee af
fected by the b'il would be compelled
by Its terms to work, that stopping
of work would not constitute "delay
ing or obstructing operation of
trains," for which the amendment
provides a fine of 3,000 or one year's
Imprisonment.
"Suppose," said Senator Hardlwlck,
"the ralldoad presidents came to ua

CHIEFS TO MEET THURSDAY
Men Oppose New Adamson Bill
Providing Straight Eight

The threat of a general railroad
strike, paralyzing the nation trans

today.
Following a. conference between
"Warren 8. Stone, grand chief of the
Brotherhood of Xocomotlve Engi
neers, and H. E. .Lewis, legislative
agent of that brotherhood, the word
went out that "a strike call is more
than a possibility."
The feeling of railroad leaders that
they were "buncoed" in the legisla
tion adopted by the last Congress to
avert a rail strike, and the bitter
opposition the rail leaders feel to the
Adamson hill, introduced yesterday,
to "put teeth" in the Adamson law.
now under Are. have combined to
create a new strike crisis.
Labor Chiefs Meet Thursday.
President Stone, of the engineers,
at the Willard today, refused to make
an authoritative statement, as he
has not yet conferred with his asso
ciate railroad leaders.
A conference of chiefs of the tour
brotherhoods will be held at Chicago
Thursday. There were reports today
that at this conference a strike call
may He-issued, under the blanket au
thority given their leaders by the
men. Mr. Stone would not discuss
this.
"The railroad brotherhoods will not
be represented by counsel when argu
ments in the Adamson law are heard
by the United States Supreme Court
tomorrow," President Stone said to
day. Mr. Stone added that be would
be present to hear the arguments.
President Stone would not discuss
the new Adamson bill, which is de
signed to supplement the present
Adamson Jaw, but it Is knows he is
unalterably opposed to 1U provisions.
Iindifs 0pee Xrw Mil
Other labor leaders attacked the
new Adamson bill aa distinctly in

provisions 'of the sew bill which the
railroad men will oppose are:
That preventing any railroad em

That providing compulsory arbitra

rail disputes are under investigation.
That empowering fhe President to-i

RIGHT TO AVERT STRIKE.
Federal Brief Asserts Railways
First Admitted the Law
Was Obeyable.
WASHI-VOTON. Jan. 8. Annul
ment of Unltrd State Clicult Judge
Hook's decision holding tho Adam
son Eight-Hour Law unconstitutional
and dismissal ot tlic railroad's suit
w asked In tho brief of the Depart
ment of Justice filed In tho Supreme
Court to-day.
"As an hours of service" net and
Ulo wage law. the Federal brief
.'Contended, "the law Is constitutional,
within the power of Congress to
enact and workable."
InfeYcntlully, the brief argued that
compulsory arbitration legislation, I
such us Is under consideration, uliio
Is constitutional In behalf of public
interests to prevent tle-upi of trans-,
portatton facilities.
Practicability of obeying the law,
the brief asserted, has been admitted
galn and ugnln by railroad official,
particularly In hearings before Con
gressional committees hist August
and In confeicnces with PreMdent i
Wilson.
"All assumed thut the mere change
from tho established and well-under-atood
ten-hour standard day to thr
proposed elght-hour standurd was all
that wftK necessary or Intondeil," the
brief stated, citing that 85 pur cent, of
the employees affected are now em
ployed on a ten-hour basis.
Admitting that a rigid eight-hour
day for train operation not com
pletely practicable, the Federal nttor
neys said tho Adamson law should be
enforced at least so far ns Is possible.
"Two co-ordluute branches of thn
Oovernmcnt have evidenced the opin
ion that the law Is constitutional,"
the brief continued. "Certnlnly this
court will not strike down the law
upon mere prophecies of Its effect."
Alleged Infringement of tho liberty
of contract, It was contended, docs not
affect tho act's validity, nor "tho as
sertion that Congress enacted this
lav from Improper motives and upon
InMifDclont information."
Arguing for the supreme -power of
Congress over Interstate commerce,
tho brief Hald:
"In tho Adamson law the Idea of
the Board of Arbitration 'has been
adopted by direct action, rather than
through a board. Wane regulation
has a vital connection with Interstate
commerce. Congress's power Is ample
enough to authorize direct control
over the wage relation of persons en
gaged In interstate- comment. There
certainly falls within that power the
right to take all steps necessary to
put down n strlko or prevent an Im
pending one." I

OF DECISION BY CIR
CUIT JUDGE HO.OK.
WASHINGTON, Jan. S. The cli
max in the test over the constitution
alitv of the Adamson law was reached
today in the Supreme court.
Arguments were begun In the Mis
souri, Oklahoma and Gulf railroad's
test case, in which the department of
justice is appealing from Federal
Judge Hook's decision at Kansas City,
that the law passed last September
when a nation-wide railroad strike

have conceded that Congress had the
wage-flxing power only in view of the
court's decision, and his name did not
appear on the court record as dissent

however, made the division five to

EIGHT-HOUR DAY!
Stirring scene from the second act of "The Weavers," showing the re

aroused by the singing of a fabor hymn. "The Weavers" tells the story of
the downtrodden Sjlesian working people in 1840. The drama caused a

that brought about a vast betterment of working conditions.
New York, Feb. 22. An eight-hour
day for every workingman!
That is the object of a great cam
paign just launched the first in
America by the Labor Center asso

Millions of striking poster stamps
will carry the message to all corners
of the country. Every union man
and. union sympathizer is asked to
use these stamps on all his corre
spondence to spread it broadside
under the eyes of his fellow-workers,
employers and the general public.
With 400,000 railway employes
threatening a strike unless they get
the eight-hour day, and the coal
miners doing the same, it is evident
this campaign is to have the greatest

declared to be theirs. They set a day to quit work in case the railroad
managers refused them the eight-hour day. Then the railroads in
augurated a strike against the public. They refused to accept freight
tor shipment, especially perishable goods. In many parts of the
country this meant appalling disaster to farmers arid particularly to
fruit growers. It meant great damage to all business—even to the
railroads themselves.
The President stepped in and sough to adjust the trouble and avoid
the disaster about to be thrust upon the country. He was not success
ful. The railway managers were particularly obstinate and refused
to concede the principle of the eight-hour day. At this point the
President put the matter up to Congress for its consideration. Con
gress, disinterested, under law bound to consider ONLY THE PUBLIC
GOOD, was forced to act in the public interest. It was not forced to
act because of any demands upon Congress by the workingmen or by
the railroad managers, but because the public interest demanded im
mediate action.
Congress acted. It passed what is known as the Bight-Hour Day
Bill for men in the employment of railroads in interestate commerce,
engaged in moving trains. EVERY WISCONSIN REPRESENTATIVE
PRESENT VOTED FOR THE BILL WHICH BECAME A LAW AND
AVERTED THE STRIKE.
I believe they did right. I believe in the eight-hour day. It is
claimed that Congress acted "without due consideration." Did it?
The question of the eight-hour day for skilled employees WAS NOT
NEW. Every Congressman who was alive to the issues of the day
must have been fairly familiar with the arguments, pro and con on
the subject of the eight-hour day. I had given this matter considera
tion years ago when I secured the 16-hour limitation for railroad
employees—the best I could get at that time.
At that time I .was met withe THE SAME ARGUMENTS which are
now being made against the eight-hour day. The railroads and some
other large employers are slow to learn, but abundant experience has
shown that for the trades, professions and crafts where skill, cour
age, caution and close attention to business are required the eight
hour day is the maximum for efficiency. Had the railroads accepted
this principle there would have been no trouble.
HOWEVER, RAILROADS GENERALLY YIELD TO NO PRINCI
PLE OF PROGRESS THAT IS NOT FORCED UPON THEM BY LEG
ISLATION.
The Eight-Hour Law for railway trainmen just passed by Congress
has been much misrepresented. During the many months of negotia
tions between the trainmen and the railroad managers, the railroad
companies conducted a tennendous campaign in an effort to influence
public sentiment against the granting of an eight-hour day to their

newspapers, and some of the small newspapers, of the country were
flooded with advertisements putting before the public the railroads'
side of this controversy. Millions of dollars must have been expended
1 WONDER THAT THEIR JUST DEMANDS
WERE NOT SOONER MADE.
As long agt^as July, 1913, in an editorial in this magazine, I said:
The wisdom of legislation providing for an eight-hour day. not
only for women but for men as well, is no longer a debatable question.
All practical experience shows that shorter hours

character of the output more than offsetting any loss from cutting down

carry on a publicity campaign to shape public opinion in favor of their
own demands. Nor did they have the additional advantage, enjoyed
by the railroad companies, of placing huge, flamboyant placards upon
the walls of waiting rooms at railway stations setting forth the case
for the railroads before the traveling public.
All this may appears at first glance to be or no importance. But
in the light of what occurred after the strike order had been issued,
and what has happened since Congress took the matter into its hands
—and acted—its bearing upon this controversy will be understood by
every citizen.
This "Eight-Hour Law" has been called a "Force Bill" enacted
under htc demands of organized railroad workmen. This is not true.
