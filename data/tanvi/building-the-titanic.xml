FINDS WATERY GRAVE ON FIRST TRIP.
OVER 1,400 PEOPLE ARE DROWNED

WOMEN AND CHILDREN WERE SAVED
But Many Wealthy and Prominent M en Are Lost.The White
Star liner Titanic, the world's great
est steamship has gono down some 500
miles off Cape Race, with 630 of her
1,300 passengers and her full crew of
860 men on board. That the greatest
catastrophe in marine history has oc
curred to a vessel of their line is ad
mitted by the oflicials of the White

The liner Carpathia, the first vessel to
come within sight of the Titanic, res

which were 670 persons most of them

women and children. Many women
and children, however, have perished.
When the Carpathia reached the ill
fated vessel no sign of life was to ho
seen anywhere, the mountainous ocean
swells giving much evidence to the
stupendous disaster. Early reports
stated that all the passengers and the
crew of the Titanic had been taken
off by the Allen liner's Virginian and
the Parisian, and the Carpathia, but
wireless message received here dis
credit these reports in every detail
No hope is held out at the offices or
the White Star line that, any man on
board has survived fo tell the story of
the final sinking of the levithian, al
though some of the women in the
boats may have witnessed the sinking.
Only by miracle, it is pointed out,
could any person who stood by the
ship escape the great vessel's power
ful suction as she sank to the bottom.
The Titanic carried the most notable
list of passengers ever borne across the
Atlantic by one vessel. Homecoming
American tourist postponed their sail
ing weeks ago so as to ride the new
wonder of the season on her maiden
voyage.
Dispatches state that the Titanic
went down at 2:20 o'clock Monday
morning. The delay in the transmis
sion of the news is attributed to the
fact that all dispatches have been sub
ject to difficult relays.
The collision of the Titanic with an
Iceberg is now known to have been
a lieadon crash that occurred while
the liner was proceeding little less

than her best speed. She was a day
ahead of her schedule and it is con
sidered probable that an attempt to
make a record-breaking voyage was
the hope of her crew when she entered
the ice field.
Her forward plates were completely
wrecked. A gaping wound opening
below her water line and letting the
water into her forward compartments.
In the meantime the lifeboats were
manned and into them were placed
as many of the women and chil
dren as they could hold. The
boats were put off while there was
yet some hope of saving the Titanic
afloat until wireless could summon
help. Later and more conservative es
timates tell of great bravery on the
part of the men passengers. There
was a minimum of disorder. John
Jacob Astor. who, with his bride, was
returning from their long honeymoon
abroad, saw his bride placed in a life
boat safely away. Col. Astor was
drowned. The work of getting the life
boats away, the work of allaying
the fears of the great crowd of pas
sengers as much as possible, the
work of keeping the pumps in opera
tion and the engines throbbing—these
tasks and countless others were direct
ed by Captain Smith, the vener
able commander of the Titanic, and
before her advent the commander of J
the Olympic who displayed almost su
perhuman power of mind and body at
the world's most horrible sea disaster, I
crowned his long and honorable serv. j
ice on the high seas.
A wireless message from the Vir- |
ginia states that the occupants of the
small boats which she picked up have •
been transferred to the Carpathia
which is proceeding to New York.
The Titanic struck the iceberg at
1:26 Sunday night and floundered at
2:20 Monday morning.
At daybreak the Carpathia arrived
on the scene and her passengers and
crew brought the small boats with
their precious human cargo into New
York.
The boats which rushed to the Ti
tanic's aid found only the scattered
life boats and a dismal scene of wreck

Official Statement.
White Star line had received no word
here at 8 o'clock other than from the
press dispatches of the reported acci
dent to the Titanic.
They were unable to understand
why thev had not received some dis-
f latches from the Titanic. The follow
ng statement was made by one of the
Officers:
"Twelve hours have passed since the
collision was reported to have taken
place and we have heard nothing of
the a- ident. It is most strange the
Titanic's sister ship, Olympic, which
has a wireless apparatus of sufficient
strength to send a message across the
Atlantic, has sent us nothing. The
Olvmpic left here last Saturday and
this morning is 360 miles away from
the Titanic. The Olympic should be
alongside the Titanic at 2 o'clock this
afternoon. The Olympic has been no
tified of the reported accident."
A wireless message from the Titanic
received shortly after midnight an
nounced the liner had struck an ice
berg off the banks of Newfoundland
and was in a sinking condition. Trans
fer of the passengers to the life boats
began at once. The accident occurred
at 10:25 o'clock last night. Two hours
later the ship's wireless apparatus,
which had been working so badly as
to permit of only intermittent and
fragmentary messages, failed com
pletely. The last words sent by the operatoi
told that the vessel was apparently
doomed, "sinking by the head" anl
that the women passengers were be
ing rushed into the lifeboats. A reas
curing feature was that the weather
was calm and clear, and help only a
few hours away.
First S. O, S. Message.
The Titanic's fii.st S. O. S. message
was received by he Allan liner Vir
ginian which, according to the posi
tion given by thi Titamic's operator
was not more than 170 miles away. The
captain of the Vi-inlan at once start-
ed his boat at full speed for the scene
of the disaster announcing to his broth
er officer on the bridge of the Titanic
that the Virginian should reach him
by 10 o'clock this morning. The Titan
Ic's accident happened in latitude 41 -4d
north, longitude 50 .14 west. This point
is about 1,150 miles due east of New
York city and 450 miles south of Cape
Race. Newfoundland, wireless station.
All the messages from the ship were
relayed to the Cape Race wireless sta
tion by the Virginia and forwarded
by the Marconi company to New York
city. The Titanic's twin ship, Olympic,
which left New York last week, wa3
also in direct communication with tne
sinking boat from a point 300 miles
away and started at once for the scene.
The Titanic, which is on her maiden
trip is in charge of Captain Smith,
who was on the bridge of the big
Olympic when that boat collided with
the British cruiser Hawke last Sep
tember. The Titanic carries 1,470 pas
sengers, of whom 318 are in the first
cabin and 262 in the second cabin.

The passenger list is a notable one

Steamship men here today character
