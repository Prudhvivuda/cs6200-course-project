Tho change has come with the arrival of tho great mass of the delegates, and thousands of hustling Republicans. Roosevelt badges galore adorn the coats of men to be seen on tho streets, men not reg Istered among the leaders and in the parlor conferences. Until Monday the anti-leaders held sway. They were tho old guard of the machine organi zation, whose own great purpose was to perpetuate their rule, some of whom were antl Roosevelt, and In whoso eyes tho President Is a politic al accident, and who bad1 to be given a renomination by force of circum stances. They threw cold1 water wherever Roosevelt sentiment ap peared, ignoring tho President in the convention arrangements, and had not thought of him in planning the decor ations. Most important of all, they decided, that one of their own selec tion should bo the new chairman of the committee, andi national leader of the party. Then it was that the Pres idents friends on the ground made a determined stand, Insisting that Cor telyou should have tho place.

The last and greatest day of the Republican na tional convention was the apothesls of the big show, the climax to which tho events of the past two days have been the Introduction. Today Theodore Roosevelt was nominated to succeed himself as President, and Charles W. Fairbanks, senator from Indiana, was named as vice-president. With tho candllates of the party selected tho convention adjourned, tho delegations dispersing1 to spread into every re mote section of the country a conta gion of enthusiastic fever which has been enthused into them at this great gathering by the leaders of the grand old party of protection. This was a day of oratorical pyro technics. Somo of the finest speakers In the Republican organization were heard in common chorus in praise of the men who aro to lead the hosts to battle. Elated by tho ovents and the speeches of the last two days, and eagerly anticipating -the intellectual treat in store today, tho delegates be gan to assemble in tho convention hall early this morning. Becauso of im portant workin hand the convention was called to assemble at 10 oclock. Half hour before the floor presented an animated scene. Many delegates brought flags with them to assist in the demonstration which they were prepared to make when Roosevelt was placed in nomination. An increased interest in the convention was also shown In the galleries, which began to fill ns soon as tho doors opened at 9 oclock. By tho time Chairman Can non called tho assembly to order near ly every seat was occupied, and short ly after standing room was at a pre mium. There was a larger proportion of ladies present than at either of the previous sessions, and their summer costumes lent a touch of color to the otherwise sombro rows of black coats. The first outburst of applause was ovoked by Margaret Elizabeth Plum mer, national organizer of the Ameri can Flag Asosciation, who was dressed in a stunning gown of cream colored silk, who surprised Chairman Cannori by presenting him with a great bunch of calla lilies, after mak ing a graceful little speech. Secretary Cortelyjpu was on the platform. As soon riS he mado his appearance many prominent leaders pressed forward to shake hands and assure him of their loyalty and assistance in the great work he is about to undertake as chairman of the national committee. Every membor of tho New York delegation, under instructions from Senators Plat tand Depow, was sup plied with fine silk flags, and their eritranco was greeted with loud ap plause Everybody arose while the band played America. Tho convention hall filled rapidly at an early hour, and every seat was filled when Chairman called it to or der at 10 oclock. Rev. Thaddius E. Snlvely opened the convention with prayer. Alabama yielded to New York on the call of states. Chairman Cannon then introduced ex-Governor Black amid great applause. At 10:41 a. m. tho clerk called tho roll of states for the presentation of the names of candidates. When ex-Governor Black finished speaking there was great applause, and the delegates were on their feet. Chairman Cannon stood on tho plat form with a tattered battloflag. The bands were playing, delegates were on their feet, and a massive picture of Theodore Roosevelt shown on tho platform brought forth renewed ap plause. The delegates of New York made a circuit of the hall, while the band played tho Star Spangled Banner. Chairman Cannon lead in singing the Star Spangled Banner, and the. band played A Hot Time in tho Old Town Tonight. Senator Boveridge, of Indiana, sec onded Roosevelts nomination with a stirring speech, and the enthusiasm is on tho Increase. Chairman Cannon was compellod to use tho gavel a number of times to bring the convention to order. The entire audience is slpging Tho Star Spangled Banner, and there are no signs of order. Delegations with red, white and blue umbrellas are making a circuit of the hall. Tho convention was still shouting for Roosevelt when Chairman Cannon again appeared on the platform with tho tattered flag, which brought forth renewed cheers, and tho convention was in an uproar, and pandemonium reigned for somo time. Geo. A. Knight, of California, sec onded Roosevelts nomination on be half of the coast states. Harry Stilwell Edwards, of Georgia, seconded the nomination with a bril liant speech. Ex-Governor Bradley, of Kentucky, made a seconding speech. Hary S. Cummlngs, tho colored ora tor of Maryland, and Jos. B. Cotton, of Minnesota, followed with short speeches seconding the nomination. When New Jersey was reached they asked for unanimous consent for tho convention to dispense with furth er roll call and nominate Roosevelt by acclamation, but the Idea did not moot with favor. When tho roll call was ended no namo had been mentioned but that of Roosovelt, and ho received tho total 994 votes of tho convention. In his characteristic stylo Senator Dolllver, of Iowa, placed Fairbanks in nomination. He paid a glowing tribute to tho policies of tho Republi can party, and to the leaders respon sible for tho exposition of these poli cies. Gradually hut adroitly he led up to his eulogy of tho Indiana statesman. Dollivers peroration was In the following werdB: While ho has not sought to con strain tho Judgment of tho conven tion, directly or indirectly, he lias kept himself free from affectation which undervalues tho dignity of the second ofilco within the gift of tho American people, and I do not doubt that his heart has been touched by tho volunteer expression of universal good will, which already has choson him a one of tho standard bearers for tho Republican party of tho United States.

REPUBLICAN PARTYS UN AN I MO US CHOICE FO R STANDARD. BEARER. Sitting tilted back in a big armchair at his desk the President chatted freely and frankly with those about him. AH were his personal friends, and the Pres ident realized perfectly that the little confidences of the executive session, as he himself termed It. would be held as Inviolable. He talked and acted not as President of the United States, not President Roosevelt rose from his chair to receive the affectionate con gratulations of those about him. He was the most unconcerned, seemingly, of all. He chatted animatedly a few minutes with Mrs. Roosevelt, Miss Carew and Loeb, and then accom panied his secretary to the executive offices. ATTENDS. TO ROUTINE WORK. Outward indications that Theodore Roosevelt was to be chosen unanimous ly as the standard-bearer of his party absolutely were lacking at the White House in the morning. The President appeared at his desk at the usual hour and began immediately to transact rou tine executive business with Secretary Loeb. The important subjects disposed of, he received several visitors .for «hom engagements had been made. No members of the Cabinet called dur ing the early hours of the business day. The President was kept In close touch with the situation at Chicago through the press bulletins and private messages from the convention hall, which were received over a special wire at the White House. On his return to the executive offices after he had been informed of his nomination. President Roosevelt greet ed cordially a number of newspaper men. He expressed his pleasure at re ceiving the warm congratulations of those who. In the performance of their duties, are kept constantly in touch with the President and his work. CHATS WITH FRIENDS. WASHINGTON, June 23.—Surround ed by members of his family. President Roosevelt received the announcement that he had been nominated unani mously by the Republicans at Chicago. The news was received by telephone at the White House by a press repre sentative In advance of its receipt over the special telegraph wire running from Chicago to the executive offices. At 1i:lZ p. m. the bulletin was given to Secretary Loeb. Some time previ ously the President had left his offices in the executive building and had gone to the White House for luncheon. Sec retary Loeb immediately conveyed the news to him there. Seated on the veranda of the White House, chatting with Mrs. Roosevelt, his sister-in-law. Miss Carew and other members of his family, tjie President received Loebs announcement. Chairman Parker of the Missouri del egation presented to the committee an A resolution was adopted authorizing the chairman to appoint an executive committee of nine, with such other of ficers as are necessary for thermanage ment of the campaign. The chairman, secretary, treasurer and sergeant-at arms are to-be officers of the executive committee. Under this resolution the chairman is given absolute power in the conduct of the campaign. INVITATION* FROM FRANCIS. After Cortelyous remarks Elmer Do ver. of Ohio was named as secretary by Senator. Scott. Cornelius N. Bliss of New York for treasurer by Governor Murphy and William F. Stone of Mary land for sergeant-at-arms by Senator Mi Comas. All of these officers were unanimously re-elected. ¦No vice chairman will be appointed, and the new chairman will divide his time between the New York and Chi cago headquarters, although some members of. the committee no doubt will be designated to take charge of the headquarters In this city. Head quarters will not be opened in either city until l the latter part of July. Meanwhile Cortelyou expects to select the executive committee and make his preliminary arrangements for the cam paign. s As soon as the committee was called to order, Postmaster General Payne, in a complimentary speech, nominated Cortelyou- for chairman, and the elec tion was made without a dissenting voice. Clayton of Arkansas, Murphy of New Jersey and Yerkes of Kentucky were appointed a committee to notify the new chairman and bring him be fore the committee. CHICAGO, June 23.— George B. Cor telyou was chosen chairman of the Republican •National Committee at a meeting held to-day, just after the ad journment of the national convention. 2n thanking the committee for the honor, he told the members that, whHe he would be glad to have the benefit of their, advice and counsel, he in tended to be chairman in fact, and would accept no dictation from any one, high or low. He told them that the friends of the late Chairman Hanna were his friends, and he asked for the same measure of confidence and support that had been given to the late chairman. In conclusion, he sought the advice of both old and new members. Cortelyou made «S formal statement of his plans. He had resigned as Sec retary of Commerce and Labor as soon as he was elected chairman, the resig nation to take effect as soon as bis successor qualifies, which will be about July 1. Secretary Cortelyou will nor give any active time to political mat ters until he retires from the Cabinet. XO VICE CHAIRMAN. Bearer of Tidings Finds Him Chatting With Members of His Family.

Former Gover nor Blacks introduction to make the Roosevelt nominating speech was the fcignal fop the first outburst of ap plause. Black led ud to the nomina tion by gradually defining: the type of man best suited for the partys color bearer. As he named Theodore j CROWD PACKS COLISEUM. When Senator Fairbanks had been nominated for Vice President there was no diminution in the demonstration. The voices were hoarse, but the shout- Ing was as general as it was for the head of the ticket. The delegates in their eagerness to exhibit approval of the nomination accepted every signal for renewed -cheering. A little colored boy from Georgia, and later a pretty little girl dressed in a dainty frock of white, were lifted to the platform, where they waved flags vigorously. At the conclusion of every seconding speech the outburst was repeated, and the speakers themselves were generally applauded. The chairman tired and his place was taken by a young man, who grasped the flagstaff firmly in one hand and with a megaphone led the yelling. He started to yell, Roosevelt, Roosevelt, Roosevelt, repeated over a^d over over again, with the system of a college yell. It was taken up by the throng, and the cry of Jioosevelt rolled over the hall in volumes so great and so ter rific that the screeching of a hundred steam whistrw v/ouid have been dwarfed in comparison. LIKE A COLLEGE YELL. When Governor Black of New York made his speech nominating President Roosevelt to succeed himself as Presi dent, the delegates in the Republican Convention proved there was no ab- Fcnce of enthusiasm in their ranks when occasion Justified an exhibition cf that Quality. For twenty-five min utes the great throng told its approba tion of the conventions choice for President. The name of Roosevelt came from every mouth. The New York delegates paraded the hall, shout ing at the top of their voices. Other delegations joined the procession, and the- weJ! ordered body of a half hour before was a shifting mass, every eemblance of organization gone. While the demonstration was at its height Chairman Cannon stepped to the front of tne stage. He held in his hand the banner which was waved in 1SG0 when Lincoln was nominated, and •which fcas been used in every conven tion since. The flex showed the wear and tear of many similar contests. Uncle Joe wa\-cd It vigorously and kept time with his body. Soon the ¦whole convention was swaying in exact measure. 1 rfiii^i by a resounding demonstration vbich attested the candidates great popularity. The charing was l=d by figures known through the breadth of the land and echoed by a mighty throne of enthusiastic men and radiant vomen assembled in the Coliseum to witness the crowning feature of the convention, as well as the close of th* rational meeting that marks the semi centennial of the Republican party in the United States. No less than 10,000 men and women participated in the ratification of the party programme and the consequent roar of cheering and handclapping was de&feninp. The band, stationed high among tho girders of the hall, was browned by the tumultuous, unbounded demonstration. Hats were tossed into the air, State emblems were waved and flags beautiful, tri-colored, shim mering, silktn flags fluttered from every hand, as though stirred by a RIOT OF ENTHUSIASM.

Geography counts but little with the sentiment and enthusiasm that is to day apparent in favor of one who is to be given all the honors anoTduties of an elected President of the United States, Knight said when silence was restored. Continuing in epigramatic style he thrilled the convention for many minutes. His voice never fal tered. His name was spoken in terms of congratulation on every side. When he had ceased, and with waving ban ners the California delegation marched to the platform to escort him to his seat, the great Coliseum rocked with the cheers of the multitude. Californias headquarters were in darkness to-night. The wines and fruits had been distributed among the fortu nate friends cf the delegates and the last toast had been drunk. Several of; the delegates have departed already, and more will go to-morrow. Within three days the last California delegata will have departed from Chicago. PARDEE GOES TO -T. LOUIS. Again the tempest broke. Out of the wilderness of silence had come a human voice. It had been heard and understood. The convention was over joyed: its enthusiasm must find vent. THRILLS THE CONTENTION. Knights voice reached to the farthest pillar and echoed back from the giant arches. With a howl of delight the con vention arose, and the waving flags with their crimson stripes were like a sea of flame. Speaker Cannon, with the gavel in his left hand pounding for order and his right uplifted command ing silence. wa3 ignored. For minutes the uproar continued. When silence came again Knight continued: ••Geography counts HEADQUARTERS CALIFORNIA DELEGATION*. CHICAGO. June 23 Californias triumph came to-day In the national convention. Her triumph was that of George A. Knight, th« eloquent lawyer of San Francisco. From 10:3* oclock until long after noon the per spirins delegates had been listening to the*disiineuished men of the East. Ex- Governor Black of New York had placed Mr. Roosevelt In nomination, and Senator Boveridge of Indiana had delivered the iirst seconding speech. To those in the rear galleries and side seats their efforts were nausht but mere pantomime. No sound strayed from a direct line in front of the plat form until Knight opened his masterly address.

The contingent now being cared for rat Aberdeen consists of twelve pas sengers, the third mate of the Norge, the quartermaster, a steward, a lamp .trimmer and one of the crew.

They had eked out an exist ence on two biscuits a day. When the survivors we re dragged on boa rd the trawler the fishermen we re i obliged foroibly to prevent them from eating and drinking too much. The third mate says that three other boats started with that rescued by the Largo Bay. One of those contained thirty-two persons, including several women and children. Another boat had fifteen men, with the second mate \in charge. The third boat had ten men on board. The survivors parted company with the three boats on July 3.

Jackson, Mich., Ju ly 6.Five thou sand people assembled in Loomls park here tod ay to celebrate the fif tieth anniversary of the birth of the republican party under the oaks in this city July 6, 1854. It was here then that the first state convention, acting under the name of republi- can, was held. The state ticket nominated on that day went thru a heated campaign to election day suc cess. Secretary of State John Hay, who was private secretary to Abraham Lincoln, the first republican president, was the orator of the day. Other dis tinguished guests present weie Speak er Cannon of the national house of representatives, Senators C.

Mayor William H. Todd of Jackson wel comed the visitors, and Governor Aaron T. Bliss responded. Attorney General Charles A. Blair of Jackson read a paper on the history of the republican party. Thomas J. OBrien of Grand Rapids, the next speaker, was one of the participants in the original under the oak s convention of 1864. An interesting feature of the exer cises was a body of Fremont voters, for whom 1,000 prominent seats had been reserved. Grand Army uni forms, crutches and silvered locks were conspicuo us among them. The distinguished guests attended a reception at the Hotel Otsego at noon. Address of Secretary Hay. Soon after p.m. the program at the grove was resumed. Senator J. O. Burrows of Michigan introduoed Sec retary John Hay, the orator of the af ternoon. Secretary Hay reviewed the record of the republican party since its be ginning with the ability of a states ma n, a historian and an orator com bineW* Perhaps he, as no other man In the country, knows the history of the party. When it Is said,-therefore, that his review of the partys past was masterly, the word masterly all that it an mean as -so applied. Mr. Hay, passing from the history of the party to the present and imme diate future, said, in part: W are not claiming that we monopo lize the virue of the patriotism of the country There are good men all par ties, I know far better men than I am who are democrats. But we are surely allowed, in a lo\e feast like this, to talk of what has been done by the family and at least to brag a little of the democrats who have helped us. We come before the country in a position which cannot be successfully attacked in front, or flank, or rear. What we have done, what -we are doing, and what we intend to doon all three we confidently challenge the verdict of the American people The record of fifty years will show whether as a party we are fit to govern the state of our domestic and foreign affairs will show whether as a party we have fallen off, and both together will show whether we can be trusted for a while longer. 7 means The 1004 Platform. Our platform Is before the country. There is certainly nothing sensational about it It is substantially the platform on which we won two great victories in the name of McKinley, and it is still sound and serviceable. Its principles have been tested by eight years of splendid success and have received the approval of the country. We stand by the ancient nays which have proved good. It would take a wizard to guess what a dainty dish our adversaries will set before the sovereign people tomorrow. One thing is reasonably sure: They will get as near to our platform as they possibly can and they will by implication approve everything McKinley and Roosevelt have done In the last four years. They will favor sound finance and a tariff which will not disturb business rigid honesty in administration and prompt punishment of the dishonest the Monroe doctrine and an isthmian canal. To be logical they ought to go on and nominate the republican candidates who are pledged to all these laudable poli cies. Roosevelt as an Issue, But they will not be logical. They an nounce* their plan of campaign to be not pro-anything, but anti-Roosevelt. Even on this issue they will dodge most of the details. Ask them, has the presi dent been a good citizen, a good soldier, a good man in all personal relations? Is he a man of Intelligence, of education? Does he Know this country well? Does he know the world outside? Has he studied law, history, and politics? Has he had great chances to learn, and has he im proved them? Is he sound and strong in mind, body and soul? Is he accessible and friendly to all sorts and conditions of men? Has he the courage and the candor, and the God-given ability to speak to the people and tell them what he thinks? To all these questions they will answer yes Then what is your objection to him? They will either stand speechless or they will answer with the parrot cry which we have heard so often: He is un safe! In a certain sense we shall have to ad mit this to be true. To every grade of lawbreaker, high or low to a man who would rob a till or a ballot box t$ the sneak or the bully to the hypocrite and the humbug, Theodore Roosevelt is more than unsafe he is positively dangerous. Coefficients of Safety. But- let us be serious with these good people. What are the coefficients of safety in a chief of state?

JOHN SHARP WILLIAMS, Temporary Chairman of Democratic National Convention. PARKER SEEMS TO BE FAR IN LEAD Nomination of New Yorker Prob able, Tho Opponents May Defeat Him. From a Btaff Correspondent. St. Louis, July 6.The opening day oil the democratic national convention sees the situation as to the presiden tial nomination unchanged. Parker Is far in the lead and is nomination seems likely. A the same time, however, his prospects are no more favorable at this time than tho se of many a defeated candidate for the nomination have been before him and it may yet be possible for his enemieB to concentrate against him and defeat hi m. The fact that thjy are as actively at ~woric tod ay as at any previous time, and profess to be hopeful of, success, makes confident prediction that Parker will certainly be nomin ated somewhat unsafe. The trend of even ts is so distinctly toward Parker, however, as to indi cate his early nomination, possibly by the second ballot. If it were a betting proposition, I shou ld say the chances were at least seven out of ten in Park ers favor. Tammany is now acting as it did in 1892, when it counseled against their renominati on of Cleveland, saying he could not carry New York. A form al statement of the Tammany position was giv en out in Chicago when the convention was in progress. The con vention disregarded the opposition ot Tammany and renominated Cleveland. It looks as if it would again disre gard this same opposition, and nomi nate Parker. MNESOTA HISTOH1CAL PAIR TONIGHT AND THURSDAY COOLER TONIGHT 14 PAGESFIVE OCLOCK. EIGHT MINUTES OF CLEVELAND CHEERS Row Develops in Demonstration Evoked by John Sharp Williams and Brooklyn Deler gate Is Ejected from Hall by the Sergeant-at-Arms. St. Louis, Ju ly 6.Exactly at noon Chairman J. K. Jones of the national committee called the democratic na tional convention to order. His ap pearance on the platform and the sou nd of his gavel brought forth a cheer from the floor and galleries. Chairman Jon es directed the ser geant-at-arms to secure order. continued belaboring the table with his gavel but it was some time before quiet reigned. the time the hall was one-third filled the heat had begun to increase to a noticeable degree. The great ma jority of the delegates and visitors had^ provided themselves with fans and the auditorium viewed from the speakers desk was one yellow flutter, as th? palm-leaf fans bobbed back and forth. The delegates lost but little time in removing their coats, and the com plexion of the lower part of the hall, black at first, became lighter and lighter, as the ooats disappeared and the shirtsleeves became evident. The first ripple of applause that went across the convention came from the galleries when the Texas del egation marched In bearing their flag of red, white and blue, with the single star. A white silk banner beari ng the in scription* Florida democracy safe and sound, was borne into the hall short ly after the Texans had arrived, and was also greeted with applause. This was five minutes, before 12, and up to that time not a handolap had been offered to a ny man who had entered the hall. The platform was crowded with members of the national committe e, but the crowd paid no at tention to them. The Fhilippino delegation came in with their banner, which was not floating free like those that had tered before it. It was an American the cheers and cries fell, there would flag of Bilk wrapped closely arou nd the staff and tied hard and fast. This was done, aocordlng to one of the Philippine delegation, with deliber ate intent, as if to show that the democratic convention did not recog nize the Philippines as part of the nation. Chairman Guffy of Pennsylvania strode in closely behind t*ie Philippine flag and,WKs~1*eiR*trry -cheered. Californias appearance with a huge silk bann er mad -sttk- ^Asnscrican flags and a yell California, California? Hearst, Hearst, Hearst, caus ed cheer ing. Bryan Rose for a Cheer. Just as the California delegation reached its reservation after march ing up and down the center aisle, Wm. J. Bryan, who had come in unnoticed, arose in his place and was giv en a cheer. Then an enterprising member of the Montana delegation created a diversion by vigorously ringing a cow bell. Again Chairman Jones demanded that the conventi on be in order and at once directed the secretary to read the call for the convention. Applause followed the readi ng of the call. After quiet was restored, Chairman Jones announced that the convention would be opened by prayer by Rev. John Cannon, pastor of Grand Avenue Baptist church of S Louis. During the invocation the conven tion stood. Dr. Cannons voice was entirely inadequate to reach even the oenter of the hall. The prayer occu pied several minute s. Enthusiastio cheering greeted the chairman s announcement that he was directed by the national committee to appoint John Sharp Williams tem porary chairman and C. A. Walsh temporary secretary, and John Mar tin, temporary sergeant-at-arms. The chairman appoint ed Colonel J. M. Guffey of Pennsylvania and M. Harper of California to esoort Mr. Williams to the chair. A the plat form was inclosed by a railing, it was necessary for the committee and Mr. Williams to climb over the railing. The committee lifted Mr. Williams safely over and the entire conventi on burst into cheers as he ascended the platform. I have the honor to introduce to you John S. Williams as temporary chairman, said Chairman Jones, and again the convention cheered. Williams Speaks. Mr. Williams was attired in a light gray suit and awhite waistcoat. delivered his address calmly and with out gestures. Several cries of louder, louder, interrupted Mr. Williams as he began, his clear but not powerful voice at first failing to reach parts of the hall. A Williams proceeded, is voice increased in volume and the delegates listened attentively. Convention Amused. The convention appear ed consider ably amused at Mr. Williams humor ously sarcastic references to the mu- tual admiration society of Mr. Roose velt and Mr. Root, and when he read a eulogy by the president on Mr. Root, the delegates laughed and ap plauded. Mr. Willjpms spoke in an ironical tone that caught the fancy of the convention, and he was interrupted time and time aga in by laughter. Cheering was evoked by the speakers statement that Mr. Rooseve lt had found praise for only three presi dentsGeor ge Washington, Abraham Lincoln and himselfand when he asked if the hell-roaring Jake Smith order was a sample of the moral sentiment for which the repub licans stood, a lusty cheer broke forth. A great part of Mr. Williams speech was delivered under great dif ficulties, for the speak er and tho se of his heare rs who were suppos ed to be most directly interested in is re marks. The aisles leading past the delegates we re packed by dense throngs, who kept up a constant hum of conversation that smothered Mr. William s voice. Policemen who we re in the space arou nd the 1stationed platform to keep others away, did it by occupying the space themselves to the exclusion of all others. times the speaker stopped and asked that the talking cease in order that he might make himself better under stood. Mr. Williams mentioned the name of Mr. Bryan in discussing the price of wheat during the first Bryan-Mo Kinley campaign. The utterance of the name called forth a little applause and some cheers. A second later mentioned the name again and the applause was not repeated. Cheer lor Cleveland. A mention of the name of Grove* Cleveland was cheered lustily. A mo~ ment later the first scene of the ses-, sion occurred. Mr. Williams declared I that it was a brazen effrontery for the republican party to attempt to seize the laurels of Grover Cleveland. A genuine outburst of applause fo l lowed. Cheer after oheer rolled thru the hall, and altho the chairman used the gavel vigorously the convention was soon beyo nd his control. New Hamp shire delegates climbed upon their seats and yelled vigorously. One Iowa man of the Hearst-instructed delega tion from that commonwealth, stood up and waved his hat frantically, and a wild chorus answered him. Three chee rs for Grover Cleve- land, shouted an Alabama delegate, and they oame with genuine power and enthusiasm. N cry came from Nebraska, where Mr. Bryan and is friends sat. quietly, without taking part in the noise. Again and again the cheers came in dense volume, de spite numerous cries of order, and the strenuous pounding of the ohalr mans gavel. Then Mr. Williams sat back and watched the sce ne he had created. As, be a renewed outbreak and the dem onstration lasted eight minute s. f/^ Brawl in Center. r& Tim Murphy of St. Louis, standing in the center aisle and encouraging the demonstration, was first requested to take his seat and then ejected from the hall by John I. Martin, sergeant at-arms. Murphy wa^jrushed towarde the platform byr Martin thru a railing and down a narrow-stairway leading omder th* ^tage. i Another encounter between Murphy* and Martin to ok place in the passage way under the stage. Murphy then permitt ed himself to be taken from the hall by two officers. Murphy said that he endeavored to assist in securing quiet, but his efforts were misunderstood, a,nd at the direc tion of Sergeant-at-Arms Martin he was forcibly ejected from the floor by a policeman, and landed among the newspaper men. Here he endeavored to explain that he had been acting in the interests of quiet and order, but his explanations fell on a deaf ear, and despite his expostulations and threats, he was finally taken from the building by the police in charge of Captain Schroeder. For several minutes after the Mur phy incident the demonstration con tinued. Finally, In desperation, Mr. Williams threaten ed to discontinue is speech. You have placed me here, I am your servant. If you dont want me to continue, it is your pleasure, he oried. This announcement was effective and Mr. Williams secured control, the demonstration that his mention of Cleveland had caused, dying slowly out. When he said that he had heard that Dewey, Schley and Miles were democrats, that a .republican admin istration had snubbed the first, tried to disgrace the second and insulted the third, the convention aga in broke out into shouts and applause. William s Voice Falling. this time Mr. Williams* voice was failing. It grew weaker and he was heard with difficulty even by those very near the platform. Mr. Williams flow of oratory was uninterrupted for some time. A re sponse of applause followed his de nunciation of the republican claims of prosperity because of the tariff. Cries of louder were again heard in various parts of the hall. I wish I had the lungs to speak louder, but I cannot, answered Mr. Williams. What did you say? came a voice from the gallery. So rapidly did the noise Increase that Mr. Williams began to address himself directly to the persons on the platform. This brought forth from the galleries loud cries of time and louder. Mr. Williams, with all the voice left, turned to the audience and, with considerable feeling, took up the race question. When he referred to the incident at the republican con vention when a colored child and white child were both on the plat form waving flags during one of the demonstrations, there we re cries of This is a white mans country! ~$0& Police Tried to Clear Aisles. g| So great did the noise become that the sergeant-at-arms went down into the hall and ordered the aisles cleared. But the police had difficulty in carrying out these instructions. Mr. Williams had by this time been speak ing an hour and twenty-five minutes. Now, a few words in conclusion, said Mr. Williams, and if you are as pleased to hear that conclusion as I am to conclude, this will be the most delighted audience that ever existed. Wiliams closed his speech at 2:05 p.m. Mr. Williams devotes most of his speech to an arraignment of Presi dent Roosevelt, ex-Secretary Root and the republican party, chiefly by as sailing Mr. Roots speech as tempo rary chairman of the republican na tional convention, which, he says, was largely historical. Mr. Williams continued: It was to draw away attention from Rooseveltism and its volcanic, eruptive and reckless character by dwelling upon Several the fact that at some period of its history W3","July 9, 1904 : Alton B.

A Sweeping Victory for the Republicans. Every Doubtful State Carried. Dem ocrats Elect Governors in Massachusetts, Minnesota and West Vir ginia----Republicans Retain Control of -House of Representatives. Special to The Times-Democrat. New York. Nov. .--Theodore Roosevelt was elected President yesterday for the term beginning March 4 next by an overwhelming majority in the electoral college and by a majority of the popular vote greater than that of any President in recent years. He carried every Northern and Western State, every doubtful State and everything but the so-called Solid South. He will have 325 electoral votes to 151 for Judge Parker. Electoral majority for Roosevelt 174. His greatest plurality is in his own State- New York. At midninht the higures in hand indicated that he will have 2: .si votes more than Parker. His vote in Illinois. in Massachusetts and in most of the Western States was larger than that of McKinley in lipi. In every State.-that he carried he ran tylly as well as McKinley did four years ago. On the other hand. Judge Parker did not get as many votes in New York as Bryan did four years ago. and seems to have run behind the Bryan tote in all parts of the country. In 1872 the electoral vote was: Grant 292. Greeley and other Demo crats 74: Grants plurality 218. In 1892 it was: Cleveland 277. Harri son 1a5. Weaver Pop. 22: Cleve lauds plurality 112. In ln4i6 it was: McKinley 271. Bryan 176, McKinleys plurality !g5. The Republicans retain control of the House of Representatives by an increased majority. The indications at midnight are that they will have from 20 to 230 members. They now have 210 members. It was apparent within an hour after the polls closed that Roosevelt had received a tremendous vote. As early as 61 oclock it was seen that his election was certain unless there should be some tremendous change. The returns at midnight indicate that about the bnly successes the. Democrats have had in the country are in West Virginia, Massachusetts and Minnesota. They elected their Governors in each of these States, although the Republicans carried them by increased majorities for, the electoral ticket. In most of the States where United States .senatorships were at stake the Republicans have elected their Legis latures. The Senators elected to begin their six-year terms on March 5, 1905, will practically be in the same proportion as to party atlliatiod as those now sitting, thus continuing the Republican control of the Senate. At midnight William J. Bryan claimed Nebraska for the fusion can didate for Governor. This probably means that a fusion legislature has been elected. Bryan made his cam paign in Nebraska in the hope of secur ing the Legislature and his election to the United States Senate. In Wisconsin Gov. La Follette was elected over the Democratic and stalwart or bolting Republican can didates. The result on the Legislature is in doubt at midnight. Unless La Follete carries the Legislature he will not be able to put his taxation theories into effect. President Roosevelt announced at u oelock that under no hreuamstapees wi be be a eaadldste tavelection in loR. rThis leaves the held open to the many Republicans who have pre sidental asjpirations, including Vice President-elect FairbanKs.

W Vat-on ran exceedingly well in some part of the South. hut most of his exlpeted strength in New York seems to have gone to Roosevelt. Debs, the Socialist candidate, re ceived 45.4tt votes in Chicago and was heavily supported in many of the cities. It is expected that his vote will approximate half a million.

Only Woman Airship Inventor. The name of the lady is Miss E. Lillian Todd, and her postofllce address is New York. She Is called 'probably the first woman In the world to de sign and build an aeroplane"" all by herself. The Todd machine was a col lapsible or folding aeroplane, and the fact of Its existence was first made public two years ago, Since that time Miss Todd has kept busy designing and making improvements to her aero plane. She Is a member of the Aero Club of America and one of the found ers of the Junior Aero club, which aims at teaching the young American idea how to fly. Miss Todd has the added distinction 'of being the builder of her flying machine as well as Its Inventor. Recently she had the good fortune to attract the notice of Mrs. Russell Sage, and It was announced","October 16, 1910 Women are becoming more frequent flyers"

Men by the score will Have died the death in the air before aerial navigation is safe. Then w oraan, the- cautious, the conservative, the primitive, will step in and rale. Why is the air woman's own do main? The answer is perfectly 'plain to both psychologists and physiologists. The periphery, the outer rim of a woman's retina, Is as sensitive to objects as is Its centre. A woman can look- away from you and still see you. Her arc of sight is almost twice that of man's, in whom, as a rale, the periphery of the retina is ex tremely blunted to impressions. Try the experiment of having a woman look straight ahead and telling you how much she still can see on each 'Bide of her without directly looking at the objects. There is a deep psychological rea son for this. Primitive man, who, surrounded by dangers, had to keep looking on every side at once, had, it is probable, almost periscopic sight, such as the birds have. He could never know what side d&Bgss, was coming from, and so eves though looking ahead, his retina, sensitised to the rims, caught Im pressions necessary to warn him of enemies or of game. Ever since woman has been the subject of man she has practised modesty. Sh has been forced to go along with downcast eyes. And yet her coqeettry has enforced upon her the necessity of seeing. The accomplished flirt has the peripheral sensitiveness to the maximum but every woman has it more or less. Walking with averted eyes for fear of husband or lover, she still sees every male and female that goes by her. She has retained this primi tive retinal faculty. By experiments at Harvard and Vienna and at Paris, a woman's arc of sight has been, measured. The accompanying diagram shows its relation to man's and to the bird's. Manifestly the sight, which more closely approaches the peris copic, is better adapted for flying, else a blrd would net have de veloped this sight.

No Place in the Air for Women By Claude Grahame-White, I HAVE taught many women to fly and I regret it My. experience has taught me that the air is no place for a woman. When calamity overtakes my women pu pils, as sooner or later I fear it will, I shall feel in a way responsible for their sodden decease. I have often taken ray. mother and my sister in the air as passengers. They un derstand aviation thoroughly. But I would never let them fly alone. The truth Is that women lack qualities which make for safety in aviation. They are temperamentally unfitted for the sport Bravery and courage are not essential in aviation. Supreme confidence in one's self a Women may possess the former, but they generally lack the latter Safety in an areoplane depends upor absolute coolness the facultj of rpj.1,1 j jurat- the Leading English Aviator. tied,"" If I may use the word, no matter what happens. Men sometimes possess this faculty, but It Is very rare In women. Professor Hensingmuller may be correct In his premises, but the conclusions he draws from them are not sustainable. Thus women may possesa a greater range of vision than men, although I have never heard the proposition advanced be fore, but that will not make them better aviators, for a greater range of vision is not needed. The aviator has all he can do to look straight ahead, and the power to see further to the right and left would prove at all serviceable. Gusts of wind and currents aTe not vis ible. As a matter of fact their presence can usually be felt long before they affect the planes. Woman's superior vision would therefore be of no value to her In that respect It Is said also that women have greater tuition than men. That may be so', but I I.do not think that the kind of Intuition they possess Jn such abundance would be of any practical use in aviation. Diffused attention, too, would be mtre xof a handicap than an advantage. What the aviator needs more than anything else is the ability to concentrate his mind on his levers. It is true that women are lighter than men. It is equally true, however, that weight will be of no conseouence In the aeroplane of the f utare, except perhaps that the greater the weight the more effective will be the aeroplane. The future aero plane will be of steel wood and canvas will be eliminated. As far as woman's milder manner ot sneezing Is concerned I cannot see how that will be of advantage. In view of the fact that, in my own experience, I have never found It necessary to sneeze at all while In the air. I do not believe that aviation increases the. tendency to sneeze, nor shouM I con sider it of the slightest Importance even if it did. It takes considerably more than a sneeze to wreck an aeroplane, or even to disconcert an aviator. The sense of balance comes to the avia tor naturally. One elevates or lowers his planes almost Instinctively, the same as one turns the handle-bars in bicycling or varies the stroke in swimming or tennis. In these instantaneous motions there Is no time for consideration. Instinct takes the place of foresight. I do not think that women are better equipped in this respect than men. t is rather a matter of experi ence than natural fitness. ftls true that with one or two excep tions women aviators have so far escaped serious accidents, it must be remembered however, that their efforts have been con fined exclusively to aerodrome flights which is a very different proposition to cross-country work and the hazardous achievements undertaken by men. When the airship becomes absolutely safe, lis It will, women may make good aviators, but they will never dominate the air to the exclusion or iron uiv more than they have domlna id an., utbei similar sphere of activity Mllll-Il Tnnmmi B"" mmm I j"""""", the Mr. Claude Grahame-White, Who Says Women Have No Place in the Air, Taking up a Feminine Passenger it may mean danger in a snddea gust of wind to the aviator. Diffused attention is the opposite of concentration. Woman has the first, man has the second. By dif fused attention we mean the quality of mind that can take in a number of details at once. This is also x prlmtlve Quality. The savage need ed it while going through the woods, and for the same reasons that be needed peripheral sensi tiveness of his retina.

Dutrieu, the Daring French Woman Aviator, Who Has Been Made a Chevalier pf the Legion of Honor hy the French Government. MLLH. HBLENB DUTRIEU, the ""Hawk Girl of Franco,"" has just been made a Chevalier of the Legion of Honor as a reward for her skill as an aviator. Mile. Dutrieu Is one of few women to receive this decoration. France has g,lven it to her because the Bu reau of War has become convinced that women make better aviators than men, and so, In Its struggle to perfect Its aeroplane Bervlce, wishes to encourage women to enter that field of action! The great ambition of the French Is to keep far ahead of all other nations In aviation. The belief that the victories of the future will 'belong to those who aro strongest In the air has becomo firmly Ingrained in the national mind. Therefore, France Is spend ing more than any other nation on this branch of service and is making extended and varied researches into the problems and possibilities of aviation. In the course of these experiments, not long ago, a series of tests were made to determine the effects of altitude and speed on tho human body and to test the reactions under the conditions of flvlnit Both men and women were used in the experiments, and when the results were tallied It was found that the woman had far outstripped the men on all Points' Other experiments were made and the ex perts in charge, as a result, have come to the surprising conclusion that woman make n much better aeroplane drivers than do men that In the future she will literally rule thThelr'report of the scientists to the -Var Department, as cabled from Paris, gives eight controlling factors for this supremacy: First Because woman is more primitive than man. Second Her nerves are not so delicate, and so she is less nervous. Third she feels pain less than man does. Fourth She needs less oxygen In her br?fth The arc of her sight Is nearly double that of man. A Sixth She has tho faculty of ""diffused at tention,"" which man ordinarily lacks. Seventh That her specific gravity Is less than man's and that the slight differences in her skeletel structure givo her an enor mous advantage in the air over her heavier, more compact mate. Eighth That her sneeze is less violent. Tho perfect aviator, says tho report, am plifying these points, needs not nerve, but comparative nervolcssnoss. The possession of what is called ""nerve"" implies a psycho logical conflict In which courage is continu ally overcoming fear. The truly courageous man is ho who fears something mightily, but who goos on and fights in spite of his fear. The man who ""never knew what fear Is"" Is not truly courageous, In tho higher sense, because It does not requlro courage to fight something of which wo nro not afraid. The ""hlghor courage"" is positively detri mental to tho aviator, tho experimenters say, because the psychological conflict between ""nerve"" and fear uses up energy and koops the aviator at a tension which does not al low tho highest efficiency as a flier. Conse quently, the typo that makes the perfect avi ator is the one that is nerveless, who has no conception of fear and faces tho perils of the air courageously because ho does not recog nize that there are any perils. Woman, it was found, has this quality to a surprising degree. She has It because she Is still the primitive sex, has doveloped less than man, not only physlologlqally, but psy chologically. Back In a far distant age man and woman were almost equally nerveless. But man's activities caused him to acquire finer and more delicate nerves. Ho has steadily become more nervous and more sensitive to pain. This incapacitates him for tho con quest of the air, while woman's lack in these respects fits her for it. The comparative Insensibility to pain is important because many an aviator has dropped to death because tho stinging cold of the upper altitudes has caused him, mo mentarily, to lose control of his machine. Again, in driving an aeroplane, the avi ator's position is more nearly quadrupedal than in any other form of locomotion. The aviator almost literally flies on all fours. Ho does this because ho can attain the best balance in this position. Here the same prlmltlveness which gives woman the lead in nervelcssness also comes to her aid. Sho is of structure more nearly the quadruped than-1b man. It is more natural and easier for her to drop on all fours and she can get about more freely In that posture than man A Photograph of the Late Harriet Quimby, the Queen of Amer ican Flying Women and One of the Very Few Women to Lose Their Lives in Aviation. She Is Shown Climbing Into Her Aero plane. airship pilot than the breast of tho Missis sippi is to the steamboat pilot and Mark Twain has told of their complexities. The peripheral sensitiveness of woman enables her to see these signs whero man's concen- can. Dr. Havelock Ellis makes the assertion trated sight misses them that the realization that woman ""is still an atomically a quadruped Is the greatest sur gical triumph of the nineteenth century."" In this connection he defended woman's use of the corset, saying that it !s needed to keep organs designed by nature for a horizontal position, In a vertical one. Man having learned what woman haB only Imperfectly learned, to stand upright, needs no corset. This quadrupedal tendency, to gether with the fact that her bones aro lighter and she has less specific gravity than man, aids her In flying, as It does in swim ming. When timidity does not restrain them women are much better Bwlmmers than men. The field of woman's sight is larger than man's. The report states it thus: ""The arc of a woman's vision is nearly twice that of man."" In other words, while man, trained to concentrate his sight upon one object, sees with only a limited part, tho centre, of the retina of his eye, woman, through centuries of slde-glanclng habits, of looking, so to speak, out of the tall of her eye, hw kept the faculty of sight throughout tho periphery of her re tina. While looking straight ahead she can see what la happening at either side of her and for a short distance behind her. This power she shares with the savage and most of the lower animals the rabbit and she be ing about equal in this respect. The faculty Is enormously valuable In tho air. Graham-White, among others, has Bald that it is of the utmost Importance to the aviator to be able to see every change in the skies above him and the land about him. Trees moving in a breeze far to the left may be a danger signal, which will mean disaster to the airman it not heeded. So of changes in clouds. The country under and the air about are filled with more slcns to the perfect In tho same way what the late great psychologist, William James, called her, ""dispersed attention,"" helps her. Man's ad vancement has developed in him a tremen dous power of concentration. This his primi tive spouse, or sister, lacks. Man concen trates his attention. Woman scatters hers. Man thinks of one thing at a time. Woman tries to think of many things nt the samo moment and succeeds. Tho span of conscious ness Is wider in woman even if it Is .shallower. Consuming less oxygen than man she 1b a shallower breather she Is loss affecod by the thin air of high altitudes. For theao and other reasons cited In tho remarkable statement by tho distinguished New York, physician, Dr. A. Monao Lesser, former chief surgeon of the lied Ctobh In tho United States, and leader of tho Eed CroBS forces in Cuba during the war with Spain, tho French Army Department has ddtermlned to recruit as many women as possible In Us flying corps. A spoclal law will hava to bo passed making them eligible to army service. Tho French aro tho most gallant ot nations. But thoy repudiate the sug gestion that they aro crowning women queenB of the nlr to make up for tho slight put upon them by art, which never carved or painted a woman an gel. Their course Is a sternly practical one, thoy Bay, and Mile. Dutrleu's ele vation to the ranks of a Chevalier la only part of a practical campaign. Dr. Lessor's statement follows: Why HOME-LOVING Woman is the Best Air Woman By Dr. A. Monae Lesser. Former Chief Surgeon of the Ped Cross of America. THERE is truth in the contention that woman because of her primitive qualities may yet rule the air. But tho type of woman who will do so is the quiet, stay-at-home woman tho housekeeper, housewife and mother. That it should be she, the woman of the hearth, Instead of the woman ot public ac tion, is capable of Bclontlflc proof. Since the dim ages of the world, when men and women were of equal prlmltlveness, man has developed far, and a penalty ot his mighty concentration has been an acute ten sion of the nervous system and a correspond ing seusltiveneBs to pain. If men were called upon to bear the pain that i'j visited upon women, especially in maternity, they would suffer doubly, and many of them would die. Even lesser pains ordinarily borne by women would send them running about the house screaming. They could not enduro what women bear because women have a greater capacity for suffering. All this is due to their: greater nerve tension, which has come with their greater advanco from prlmltlveness. Tho greater nerve tension haB produced a different kind of nerves. Scattered through the membranes of their bodies are nerves of a finer, more delicate order. Men sneeze more violently than women because in the membrane lining of the noao are a finer grade of nerves, more delicate, moro sensitive to intruding dust or to changes of temperature. The woman who has developed along lines of domesticity has little or no such nervous sensitiveness. Her sensibilities are coarser, because they have never been de veloped to the knlfo-llko edge of man's. It is not, according to some aeronauts Claude Graham White, I bellevo among them not nerve, but lack of nervousness, that makes great aeronauts, Nervousness during an ascent Is fatal. That state which we term ""nervelessness,"" tho absence of finely attuned nerves, is better than courage In an emer gency. Imperturbability Is a safeguard, and the woman of low order ot nervousness 1b im purturbable. One type of woman should be barred from the air, and she, unfortunately, la the kind that would rush Into it. That 1b the worn at. who Is the opposite of the primitive the advanced woman. In the last hundred years a minority of women has developed enormously in men tality, and In tho ncuteness of nervous or ganization that accompanies a high order of mentality. This minority of their sex has developed with men, equally with them, and their nerves have attenuated to the fineness I have described. These are sterile women, women who aro childless, and who have de veloped almost abnormally their minds Such as these, laboring under all the disa bilities of men by the fineness of their nervous organism, should never be permit ted to make an ascent. Take a woman from the nursery, from tho Ironing table or from beside tho kitchen range, but not a woman from tho desk or studio, to make the conquest of the alrl In such a woman as I first described the primitive qualities have remained the ""peripheral visual attention"" which William James cites, the ""dispersed attention."" the lack of necessity of the violent sneeze.

PROPOSAL lias been made to or ganize a corps of women aviators to servo with the allied armies of England and Prance, now lighting the Germans. The idea Jsas oeon received with en thusiasm by many women, who reject the ancient theory of feiyinine weakness and declare that their sex is fully as lit to t'aee peril as the men. The aviators have proved themselves one of the most valuable factors in the war. There is a great need of more of them, and it* is impossible to train them in a hurry. This Is one of the strongest reasons urged in favor of using the many skilled women aviators in the lighting. The suggestion has actually appeared in print that Lady Victoria May Pery, daugh ter of the Earl of Limerick, i.hould become chief of a British royal feminine flying corps. Lady Victoria is 0*e of the most dashing jidJ certaluly the prettiest of English women aviators. She was trained in avia tion by Graharae White and the late, Gnstav Hamel. in whoso company she ""looped the loop"" in al most daring manner. Mantel was eventually killed while doing this trick. It is not likely, however, that Lady Vic toria will take the suggestion and join the fighting aviation corps, for she has gone to the United States and there become the bride of Mr. James C. Brady. We have probably not yet reached the point where a bride will interrupt, her honeymoon to go off to the war, aft^r the fashion of the German submarine captain who left his bride of the before to steam away and blow up three British warships. There are, however, plenty of English women and French women without en cumbrances who are ready to fight in the air corps. Why should not women serve as military aviators? They have the courage and the skill. They have the patriotism. If they are inferior in weight ahd muscle to men, these qualities are not of the first im portance to the aviator. In steadiness and nerve, which are the essential qualities in the air, the modern girl claims to be fully the equal of her brother. ?Is it contrary to the principles of civiliza tion and humanity to expose gentle women to physical hardships and the horrors of war? This argument has largely been dis posed of in recent discussions. Women are employed in all sorts of occupations that shorten and endanger life. It has now been proved' that in every war many women have fought, very'cred itably, In spite of all rules against their par ticipating. Many women took part in the last. Balkan war, and it fs already certain that a considerable number of French women ere now fighting. Women are freely risking their lives with the Red Cross forces and as nurses in other* organizations at the front. Many W of these nurses have already been killed, and there is little doubt that oth??rK will be. N'o one seems to have any strong objection to the employ ment of women nurses at the front. Tim prejudice is-not-against their risking their lives, but against their becoming combatants. [?*rom all this It appears clear that If conventional restrictions were removed there would be a very great number of effective women combatants. And if they are to fight, why not in the air. where their nerve and daring would be of most value? One of the most daring of women avia tors is Mademoiselle Helene Dutrieu. of France. She was the first woman to per-, form the loop-the-loop trick, that ""death defying stunt that made men's blood stand s;ill when they first saw a man do it .Mademoiselle Dutrieu did it as coolly and cleverly as any man. .She is a tall, siender girl with an ex quisite figure, as supplfc as a bamboo and as strong as steel. She,has carried a man passenger very ot\en. and is therefore well qualified for war aviation, in which two persons in a machine are almost a necessity. Mademoiselle Dutrit?V received the Legion of Honor decoration for her ex ploits. She would undoubtedly make a daring leader of fighting aviators. Among the many brilliant French air women arr Madame Francis, Mademoiselle Julienne Marehnl, the Baroness Raymonde do la Roche, Mademoiselle Marvingt- and Mademoiselle Valentine Duels. The Baroness Raymonde de la Roche started flying at Mourmejon and broke her. arm in oye of her first flights, in Egypt she flew over the Sphinx and the Pyramids. At St. Petersburg she .flew over the city anil was warmly congratulated by the Czar. She flew over Budapest', in Hungary In one of her first attempts she came near having a faial accident, and many people thought the experience would rob her of her nerve completely. She was t arried by the wind over a clump-of trees. She did her best to avoid them with a swift turn of the aeroplane rudder, but the ma chine, rushing through the air at express train speed, touohed the topmost branches, and with a whirling crash it came sweep ing to the ground and was wrecked irre trievably. Instantly the spectators rushed to the spot, expecting to pick up the body of the aviator, but the Baroness extricated herself from the debris qtiiie unhurt and not at all frightened. Indeed, she laughed at the startled faces about Iter and said calmly: ""An uncomfortable experience, it is true, but I rather expected it."" The next day she was in the air again with a new machine. Mademoiselle Marvingt began her train ing with two men, Wnchter and Laffont, who were subsequently killed. This did not daunt her, and she went, on and won a cup for flying women.' Miss Eleanor Trehawko Davies has the reputation of being the i\ij>st daring of English aviatric.es. She has flown across the 'English Channel several times.\On one occasion, when crossing with Oust^v Hamel, she saved them both by working the second -pressure pump, when he was partly benumbed with cold, at a height of $,000 feet.

Eighth?That her sneeze is less violent. ""The perfect aviator.*' says the doctor's report, amplifying those points, ""needs, not nerve, but comparative nervelessness. The possession of what is called 'norvo' implies a psychological conflict in which courage is continually overcoming fear. The truly courageous man is lie who fears something mightily, but who goes on and fights in spite of his fear. The man* who 'never know what fear is' is not truly courageous in the higher sense, because it does not re quire courage to fight, something of* which we ?re not afraid.

Her monoplane had turned turtle with her at Issy-les-Mollneaux and she escaped only with a severe shaking up, having been saved by the upper stays of the machine. She has had many another close call. Always glad to escape the discussion of the graver aspects of the work, especially as it conce'rns herself. Mile. Dutrieu very soberly says that she felt one of the great est elatlons c? her life when she flew high above the historical belfry of I-.es Halles at Bruges, celebrated by Longfellow. As the people wildly cheered In the streets, the bells pealed out in her honor whlJe she circled above the structure and then flew back to Ostend, carrying a passenger. But no greater and yet scarcely justifled apprehension did she ever reel, looking into the face of danger and sudden death, than that which seized her when, on her arrival at Ostend, she had to be protected from a joyously hysterical crowd bent on kissing and embracing her! The record of this incident tells us that: ""The mayor and all the officers of the city led In the shower of congratulations that fell upon Mile. Dutrieu. The men became even more hysterical even than tho women, gesticulating and shrieking like mad?stirred to uncontrollable laughter and tears, stretching their hands toward her. Thus they pressed around the girl and the flying machine. And so she had to be protected?so many desired to kiss her."" She was the first woman to fly Into Belgium. Two officers only had done so before her. And over the air lanes that she sailed in her journey of a new achievement, now speed swift, sinister things of the air that spit singing death through the void and on the earth below, or drop thunderous destruction as they pass swiftly through the night. ""Nervous?"" she repeated the query, smiled and was silent for a moment. ""My friend, one must not be nervous la the upper air, or one, will never go there again. The true aviator must be without nerves.' She'a a Homing Bird. ""Of course, I'd much rather fly than vote,"" she continued; ""though you doubtless thluk it would be well for a woman, having accom plished the one thing to seek to achieve the other. A woman may rty a-id be at the same time a hom ing bird by Instinct?this the view as concerns myself, of course. You ""Then courageously would she fly in the direction of the expected danger, circling around, rising and descending with eyes keen to the quest and nerves as steady as the metal mechanism that held her afloat above the city."" see, therefore, I am not a suffra gette. I think woman has all she can do and all she should do, If she is a home-maker and a good moth er. And the French, husband thinks so, too. ""As for voting, that would be an Impossible situation in France. The French women,"" and her shapely hands fluttered prettily, ""are too emotional and excitable. So, too. are our men. It can easily be seea that they very likely would become so excited over the issues that life would be made utterly un bearable."" The flrst woman air scout became interested in flying about eight years ago. and, noting her youthful appearance now, one estimates that the must have been a slip of a girl when the fusillading motor sent th* earth away from beneath her for the llrst time. But what matters the years? Mile.

IN her forthcoming book on the history of the Red Cross So ciety, a review of whose preliminary chapters has already ap peared in the New York Sunday Herald, Miss Clara Barton will give to the world a thrilling— almost a grewsome— narrative of official mismanagement. Through the courtesy of the pub lishers the advance sheets of those newer portions of the work that deal with the Cuban campaign are here reviewed. The state ments are Miss Barton's, and will appear over her own name in the volume to be issued next month. It must remain for the War Investigation Commission to lay the blame for the shameful mismanagement she describes on the proper shoulders. Every candid reader will rise from the perusal of the book with the fixed impression that had it nut been for the aid cheerfully extended by the Red Cross and grudgingly accepted by the military authorities, the loss of life and health at Siboney and Santiago would have been well nigh unparalleled in the history of modern warfare. The publishers of the book are the American National Red Cross at Washington, D. C. IN reviewing Miss Barton's forth coming book I must necessarily pass over much that is Interesting about the beginning of the Red 18 campaign in Cuba and the official stumbling blocks placed in the society's way, and come down to the .Bltuatij-in just previous to the destruc tion of the Maine. At this time Miss ■Barton was already well established in r.Cuba, and was dispensing relief at ■-Ceno, a suburb <.f Havana. Explosion of the Maine. It. was before this good work was well In-hand that the explosion of the Maine ■'occurred. Miss Barton describes how; on th/> memorable February 15. the clerical work to be dono was so heavy ..that it kept herself and Mr. Elwell, her .'lnterpreter and secretary, busy at tjieir writing table until late at nicht. ""The house had grown still, the 'ibises' on the streets were dying away, ..'When suddenly the table shook from xinder -our hands, the great glass door on the veranda, facing the i-^a, flew open; everything in the room was In motion or out of place, the deadening roar of such a buret of thunder as, perhaps, one never heard lpefore, and off to the right, out over the bay, the air waa filled .-with a blaze THE CALL Sunday Edition. of light,' and this, in turn, filled witn black specks like huge epeters flying in all directions. ""Then it faded away. The bells ran*, the whistles blew and voices In the street were heard for a moment. Then all was quiet again. I supposed it to be the bursting of some mammoth mor tar or explosion of some magazine. A few hours later came the terrible news of the Maine."" Some forty of the wounded were brought ashore and placed in the Span ish hospital of San Ambrosio. All the jni'mbers of the Red -ross hurried to th ir relief. Upon the advice of the Consul Gen eral at Havana the lied Cross retired when the President recalled all Ameri cans home. The day before they ]*-f t Cuba the Archbishop of Havana pub licly blessed the Lee Orphanage in the presence of a large crowd. In the eyes Of nil Catholics, Cuban and Spanish alike, this blessing was a symbol of protection by the church and a warrant of success. Hence Miss Barton was not surprised to lea-rn several months after the war had begun that the Spanish authorities had not only taken the most scrupulous care of the hospital, but had also placed a guard around her former private residence. Return to Key Weet. On April 11, 1898, Miss Barton and her staff! boarded the ship Olivette and after a great deal of discomfort caused by overcrowding of passengt s and stormy weather, reached Tampa, Fla., two daya later. Leaving the rest of the party at Tampa, Miss Barton proceeded to Washington with Drs. Hubbell and Egan. The Red Cross agents left in Florida found work enoug-h to hand in looking after the 1500 Cuban refugees In Tampa and the 800 or 900 in Key West. These people were almost entirely de pendent for a period of some seven months upon the good offices of the Red Cross agents. In the meantime Miss Barton, in Washington, also had her hands full. Early in April it had been decided by the Cuban Relief Committee in New York to charter a steamer in that port, load her with supplies and send her to different ports in Cuba, where her cargo could be unloaded in such quanti ties as might be required. The steamer Btate of Texas was ac cordingly selected. Notwithstanding the departure of the Red Cross party from Havana and the subsequent declaration of war with Spain the preparations were kept up and the steamer was load ed with a cargo embracing a fine as sortment of necessaries and delicacies, medicine and other hospital stores. She arrived at Key West on April 28, and was met by Miss Barton, who had come down from Washington, and all the Red Cross assistants who had been left in Tampa. Key West at that time was a very busy place, the harbor being filled with naval vessels which came in daily from the Cuban blockade squadron for coal and provisions. There was scarecly a day that some accident did not hap pen to sailor or workman. The Red Cross doctors were at all times in de mand. In order to keep every one in the best preparation for possible con tingencies those on board the State of Texas were instructed and drilled in the various phases of their particular work, and at all times of the day the Red Cross boat, with its well known flag floating, could be seen going from one transport to another on Its errand of mercy. Prisoners Left to Starve. There were other charities which clamored for the attention of the Red Crocs officials. Scarcely a day passed that Borne of the blockading squadron did not bring into Key West from one to three captured prizes— ships, schoon ers, steamers or fishing smacks. With in a couple of weeks after the declara tion of war there were between thirty and forty of these boats lying at an chor in the harbor with their crews aboard under guard. Somehow it was forgotten these poor foreigners must eat to live! Or perhaps somebody thought that somebody else was re sponsible for this very important mat ter. At all events, when the small amount of provisions aboard the boats at the time of capture had been exhausted, calls were made on the United States Marshal for additional food. Having no contingent fund upon which to draw, and knowing the quantities of red tape that must be unraveled before he could SAN FRANCISCO, SUNDAY, JANUARY 15, 1899. secure any relief, the Marshal came to Miss Barton with his troubles. That good lady reassured him by promising to provide for all the prisoners until such time as he could Ret his petition through the circumlocution office.' Sev eral boatloads of provisions were hasti ly gathered and taken in tow by a steam launch, which landed them alongside of each prize. Miss Barton visited every boat in per son, learned the wants of the crews through an Interpreter, and not only supplied all needed foods, but ar ranged to take all letters and forward them to their destination through the intermediary offices of the Red Cross at Portugal. Could Not Reach Reconcentrados. On.' June 20, everything being in read-* mess, and no disapproval having been elicited from the Navy Department, it was decided to sail and find Sampson's fleet near Santiago de Cuba, Here it was generally believed that General Shafter would try to effect a landing. On the 25th the State of Texas arrived off Morro. Castle, at the entrance of Santiago Bay. The Spanish flag was flying over the land fortifications and Sampson's fleet was stationed in the adjacent waters. Miss Barton sent a 'representative aboard I the flagship New York asking Rear Admiral Sampson for instructions. Word was returned that General Sh.af ter's army had disembarked at Bai quiri, a point about twelve miles east if Morro Castle. The admiral advised Miss Barton to take her ship to Guan tanamo.Bay, where she would find good anchorage and calm water, and where she would be able to learn more of ivhat was taking v place on land, as there was constant communication from there with the invading army. rho Texas accordingly drew away and irrived that evening at Playa del Este, lust inside the mouth of Guantanamo F3ay and some forty miles from Santi igo. Here two reporters from New York japers called. on Miss; Barton, inform ng her that' they had Just come in Crom Siboney, where there was great leed of supplies and medical aid. They old how, many of the wounded in the Ight between the Rough Riders and the Spaniards, on the previous Friday, had iust been brought in and were suffer ng from lack of everything in the way if comfort and conveniences. The steamer was at once headed westward md started to the scene of suffering, which she reached at 8 o'clock. A party of doctors accomplished a difficult 'landing' in an open boat and found their way to the army hospital. This was a rough wooden building which had evidently been used for a store and warehouse in more peaceful times. The surgeon in charge, Major Havard, stepped forward to greet the visitors, who formally offered him. in the name of Clara Barton and the Red Cross, the personal; services of all their doctors and nurses and any of their supplies that might be needed. These were courteously refused. Major Hav ard thought that .he and his assistants would be able to take care of all the 3ick and wounded, and, as for supplies, lie knew that there was an abundance of them on the transports, which he hoped would be landed next day.","April 11, 1898 : Barton sets off to Cuba to help the injured during the Cuban insurrection."

Three electric cars that were passing at the time were wrecked and one ot them was burned. Several bulldingsin the vicinity were more or less damaged. The explosion was caused by escaping gas. Among the buildings damaged are the Hotel Pclliam, the Knickerbocker and Head buildings and the Masonic Temple. Window glass in buildings within 200 feet of the scene of the explosion were shattered. At least twelve persons were killed. Four bodies have been removed to un dertaking' rooms. Forty-two persons arc at the Emergency Hospital. Among the dead are: Rev. W. A.

The explosion came Jutt as the streetcars were almost in the ceutcr of the space at the corner. The first car was In the center when the explosion came. The whole of the wood work, which is used as a bridge over the subway, was lifted into the air, carrying the first car with it and taking along the two horses of the second car. The other Tehlcles were lifted straight into the air, but came down on the tracks. Instantly the air was filled with flying debris. The firat electric car, the one in which most or the killed were riding, no sooner reached the track than It broke in hair, and the whole portion Immediately burst into flame. Then someone sounded a fire alarm. This brought a large rescue force to the scene, and almost immediately calls were being sent out hurriedly for the am bulances. It was an awful Eight that met the gaze of those who were first on the scene. In the center was the long blazing electric car. .Close beride this were the bodies ot the two horses killed instantly, and about ten, twenty, thirty feet away from where the woodwork of the car was blazing lay the dead and wounded people. Those who wore not injured in the cars on Boylston 6treet were Incapable ot action at first, and people in the buildings and stores surrounding did not know what had occurred, but it did not take them long to secure their senses, and almost imme diately there was a rush to the assistance ot the wounded. It is stated that there was not a person on the three cars who was not injured, and all the wounds received were severe. Im mediately stores and offices were con verted into temporary hospitals until am bulances could arrive. 1 1 was a gruesome spectacle to see these bodies exposed on the sidewalks. Hose carriages were pressed into service as ambulances, and immediately they were started on their humane duty or getting the maimed to the hospitals.

Contention of Trafllc In tli? Iluny Streets of the Uub Relieved by Underground Trolley Lines?Tunnels Tlmt Am Light, Clean uud Attractive. It is now possible to cross Tromont street, Boston, at any point opposite tho Common and at any time of day without loss of life or limb. Tho new subway has brought about tho change. It 1 s an old tradition that tho fathers of Boston, when thoy laid out tho city, let the. streets follow the winding cow paths. At any rate, the streets ius thoy exist today urc very crooked and must of them aro very narrow. This was all right in Revo? lutionary times, but when the city grow miles beyond tho Common und spread it? self out to tho south and west; when busi? ness centered itself along tbu lower ends of Washington and Trentont streets, and when dozens of street car tracks usurped tho narrow roadways, then the Bostonlans wished their ancestors bud not stuck so closely to the cow paths. Probably no other city on the continent, was ever so badly allllctcd with a conges? tion of trnllic as tho Hub haslieon for many yea: Some of tho most important street ear linen skirt tho south and east, cornets ol the Common on Boylston mid Tremont streets. When I he chango was made hum hoc. epov.vr to trolley, matters grew worse. Then tho poles and the tan? gle of overhead wires made that historic. breathing spot look liko a pieco of dingy, green billiard cloth which had become fray? ed and tuttered around the edges. So after much wrangling in tho legislature and courts it w;ls decided tu build the subway and put the trolley cars underground. A large portion of the work bus already lieen accomplished and Boston is delight? ed with the result. The first thing a Hus? ton man asks a visitor from Now York, Chicago or elsewhere is: ""Been through tho subway yet'/ Let's see?you huven't one in your place, have you?"" It is, in fact, a triumph of engineering anil well worth a visit. Then! arc throe open cut.s where tho trolley curs enter the subway. One Is out on Tremont street whore Shawmut avenue comes in. Hero the tracks from each of those jmorough fares dive into the tunnel. Another is In the Public gardens, where the cars com? ing down Boylston street take tho under? ground tlip. The third is at tho northerly end of the subway, just beyond-Hay mar? ket square and in front of the new Union terminal railroad station into which the Fitchburg, Hoston und Maine, Eastern und other roads run. Theru is u. loop hern DOSTON'S NEW SUBWAY INCLINE IN THE Plin LIC ns most of the t rolley lines inako it their terminus, and, the subway being four tracked, they disgorge their passengers and take the back track up town. Including the inclines or open onto, tho subway has a total length of 1 miles and will contain about live miles of track. At present the branch down Boylston street along the Common side and the main line down Tremont to Park street are in oper? ation. The Shawmut avenue branch and tho northerly end of the main lino will be finished within the next eight months. Ground was broken for the subway in April, 18115. The sum appropriated was $7,ii(?0,000 and, wonderful to relate, tho transit commissioners say that it is proba? ble the cost will bo about $1,000,000 less than that sum. No groat difficulties have been encoun? tered thus far in digging this big liplo In the ground. Of course there were count? less sewers, water pipes, gas pipes, electric wire conduits and the like und some -III inch water mains at an inconvenient level proved rather hnrxl to handle, but n? un? expected conditions arose to delay tho work. The main trunk of the subway runs under the wide walk or mall on tho east side of the Common, anil when the excavations were being made the bones of hundreds of old Puritans were disturbed. This raised a bowl of righteous Indigna? tion,and the sncredness of the long forgot burying ground was harped upon for weeks. Hut the commissioners quieted the reverent patriots by collecting nil tho bones and roiuterrlng them in the holy ground of the Common, with a nice monu? ment to mark the spot. The tleepest jioint of tho subway is on Boylston street, where the south bound t racks are laid lit) feet lielow the surface, but the average depth is 14 feet. The tun? nel itself is a giant bore with ribs of steel mid casings! of cement, asphalt, concrete and masonry. The roof is a series of arches und the floor Is concave, with drains at the bottom. As tho drnins are below the level of the sewers, jilts have been established at Intervals, and when thev are filled with water automatic elec? trical pumps are started, which empty them Into tho sewers above. Perhaps yon imagine that Boston's sub? way is a tlark, damp, ill smelling place. It is nothing of the sort. The entrances to the stations aro handsome structures of stone, with glass roofs.

V XEED OF TUB BUDWAT. A Bostonlans are proud of the subway.

Tho building of tbo subway growoutof a publloneed Tfhloh was as absolute and pressing as the need v ef this city for some addition to Its trafllo in. facilities. Hien, about ten years ago. the West End oet Railway Company began to transform tho horso car lines of Boston Into electric trot lines the narrow streets In tho heart of iton were already choked with tho dally rush vehicles. Boston has to-day tho most ex stve and comprehensive electrlo car system the world. The added cars which wero re red for tho now service fairly filled i streets of the little central city ere they were all concentrated. These lines eorvo a suburban population of trly a million persons, and it is possible to ;e a car for any part of the territory covered .hoot going more thai a quarter of a mllo In i city. Under a special act of the Lcglsla e the Boston Transit Commission was ap nted to devise a suitable means to relieve the Station. THE OrERATIVB COWTnAOT. fader this commission tho subway wns nned and is being built. Tho city of Boston s for it and leases it to tho West End Street llway Company for twenty years at an an il rental which is not to be less than 4Ts per it. upon the net cost of the tunnel, or more ,n .Ts per cent, upon tho sum of $7,000,000, he tunnol should cost so much, and tho com ly agrees to pay. in llou of interest, a toll of nts for each car that passes through the way. In caso the aggregate of tolls should :eed the interest charges. The railroad com ly cares for it, lights it, ventilates it, ana ips It free from wator. i fork was bosun on the subway on March 28, 13, and on Sept. 1 of this rear the first scc o was put Into use. A second socllon was put o use on Sept. 30. The main part of tbo sub y now in use lies usdor Tremont street, bo sen Park street and Boylst:n street. This lion 'Is 1,700 feet long and contains four cks. At both ends aro stations, built nmodlously under ground and approached m the surface by wide, easy stair ye. wulch are protected by small or mental stone buildings. At the BoyI in street station the tunnel divides into o two-tracked sections. Ono of these con ues under Tremont street for about 1,200 it, whon its comes to tho surfaco and empties cars upon the tracks in Tremont street and awmut avenue, which hero diverge. The ler branch turns sharply to the wostward, asunder the edge of tho famous Common, to Public Oarden beyond Ohnrles street, where comes to tho surfaco, 1,200 foet from the ylston streot station, and its cars goon tholr y down Boylston street, man standahd or coxsTitucnos. The tunnel Is kept almost as light as day im end to end. At the stations It ls lined on sides with enamelled white brick. Through t its length and on tho codings at tho itlons It Is pnlnted white.

Boston, June 20.— Within three years the crooks and turnings and devious wanderings of Boston's most honored highways and byways will be nothing more than a memory of the past, and many of her ancient landmarks will be wiped out or so altered as to be unrecognizable to the oldest inhabitant. Slowly and surely the ancient thoroughfares are being widened, straightened and bent into the rulerlike lines oC i rosscut New- York. Philadelphia and Chicago.

Along State-st., beneath the spot where the Boston Massacre occurred, and beneath the his toric old State House, a tunnel is eating its way from under the harbor to Scollay Square to con nect with the present subway by means of (lights of stairs and elevators, and thence out side to the busy world. The old Slat- House itself is to be transformed into a tunnel station connecting with a subway line also. The re modelled building will soon be crowded with people hurrying back and forth, intent on busi ness, with never a thought of its old associa tions. Little do they think, as they hurry past where tunnel workmen are digsing seventy feet beneath, of what has happened In that quaint old edifice. On this site the first State House was built in 1G57. Destroyed by fire in 1711. it was rebuilt In 1712, and rebuilt again in 1747, when destroyed a second time. The building has been in turn Town House, Courthouse.

The British troops were quartered within the building in 17'J.S, and the Boston Massacre oc curred about fifty feet away on March 1770. The next day Samuel Adams stood in the coun cil chamber and made his successful demand upon the royal representatives fur the immedi ate removal of the British troops from Boston. In this same room Generals Clinton, Howe and Gage held a council of war just before the bat tle of Bunker Hill. In 17N'J, at the western end of the State House, Washington reviewed the great procession in his honor on the occasion of his last visit to Boston. Here, also, in lSi>s, William Lloyd Garrison found refuge from a mob which had broken up an anti-slavery meet ing, and threatened his life. The Park-st. station of the present subway handles I!7,course of its trolley traffic, but the number of passengers who will pass through the old State House station will far exceed this number.

Buildings for hundreds of feet in all directions were damaged by the concus sion, and several electric cars, which were passing at the time, were wrecked. One of these caught fire and was burned to the tracks. The property loss will amount to thousands of dollars, includ ing not only that sustained by real es tate owners, but also that resulting from a general demolition of geods in several of the steres in the vicinity. The corrected list of killed is as follows: Rev. W. A. Start, D. D., Medford, bur sar, Tufts cellege. Willlam L. Vimal, Salem, Mass. Miss A. M. Bates, Boston. Guilford B. Bigelow, driver, West End sf:'w\:: rallway. Ednjamin Downey, herdic driver, Bos ton. Delane M. Sibley, cab driver, Boston. The most serieugly injured are: Fred Deeley, Boston, dislocated elbow, lacerated wound across the eyes and head and centusion of back. May die. B. R. Sargent, Boston, compound frac ture of skull; expected to die. Willlam Maybour, Boston, fracture base of the skull. Paul Hackett, Bosten, both legs brok en, head cut.

Brown, Regent street, Roxbury, a reporter, spine injured. Charlotte N. Nair, 371 Center street, Jamaica Plain, fractured thigh. Miss Aliee Richardson, 9 Falirfield etreet, Boston, fractured thigh. Sarah Fleming, 19 Marlboro street, in i juries to head and back. Thirty-five others received minor in juries, which were dressed at the Emer gency hospital and the police station, and all returned to their homes. The explosion is thought to have re sulted from the ignitien of gas from a leaky main, eitherj by a gpark from a CASTORIA. passing electric car or from an improp erly insulated wire in the subway. An investigation to determine just what was the cause will be held by the city au thorities. Mayor Quincy, who was promptly on the ground, stated that there would be no delay in looking ints the matter. y The street was crowded with pedes trians and vehicleg, besides the cars. Suddenly the earth and planking which comprised the roof of the subway at that point burst open with a terrific re port, and, while the ground trembled, the air wag filled with dust and smoke and flying debris. Cars and carriages were tipped over and their occupants thrown out into the midst of the wreck age. Flames leaped from the opening in the street and seized upon the splin tered woed of the cars which had been torn apart, and seon a brisk fire was burning. An alarm was given and a few moments later the rushing engines add ed their din to the confusion. The fire men went to work promptly and the flames were soon put out. Meanwhile a vast crowd gathered and scores of ready hands began the work of rescue. It took congiderable courage to approach the scene, for, besides the tangled and twisted rails and lronwork which supported the roof of the subway, the live trolley wires, which had been broken apart, dangled dangerously in all directions. The West End emergency men shut off the power as soon as possible, and the rescuers suffered less obstruction. The first bedy taken out was that of Rev., W. A. Start, an aged man, and bursar of Tufts college. He was about to board a Brookline car when the explo sion occurred. Both of his legs were blown off, and the bones protruded from the flesh. The car which he was about to take was directly over the spot where the gas ignited, It was raised bodily frem the track by the force of the concussion, and, dropping back, it split in two, and then the tlan.es seized it. Near this car was another, a herse car of the Back RBay line, of which Guilford Bigelow was the driver. Moth horses attached to the car were killed and mutilated in a sick ening manner. Bigelow’s body was taken from bencath the car, which was badly wrecked. ESeveral other cars in the vieinity were also badly shattered. William L. Vinal, a passenger in one of the cars, was found dead. Delano M. Sibley, a herdic driver, was also picked up dead. Benjamin Downey was alive when rescued, but he died on his way tc the hospital. Miss Bates, who was also killed, was driving with her sister-in-law. The ear riage was overturned and its occupants thrown out. Miss Bates was taken up dead. Her compaion was hurt. The dead were removed to an under taker's reoms nearby, and the injured were promptly taken to the hospitals. Every ambulance in the city and every police patrol wagon in the vicinity were impressed into service. The work of rescue was accomplished in remarka bly quick time, and the coolness of a large squad of police who were sent to the scene soon allayed the excitement. Fortunately, no men were at work in that section of the subway, as that part is nearly completed, and the gas main in which the leak occurred was between the roof of the subway and the surface of the street. The leak which caused the trouble is said to have been noticed sev eral days ago, and, it is stated, the proper officials were notifled.","March 4, 1897: Escaping gas in Boston Subway during construction creates havoc; many killed by explosion; half a hundred injured."

Tho now subway has brought nbnttt tho chntiffo. It Is an old trmUtlon that tho fathers of Doston, when they lnld out tho city, let tho streets follow tho winding cow paths. At nny rate, tho streets iw they exist today nro very crooked and most of them nro very narrow. This wn all right In Revo lutionary times, but whon tho city grow miles beyond tho Common and spread It self out to tho south and west; when busi ness centered itself along tho lower ends of Washington nnd Truiiiont street"", nnd when tlorcns of street car trucks usurped tho narrow rondwoys, then tho Bostonlutis wished their nncestors had not stuck so closely to the cow paths. rrobably no other city on tho continent was over so badly afflicted with n conges tion of trnlllo as tho Hub has been for many years. Homo of tho most important street ear lines skirt tho south and east corners of tho Common on lloylston and Trcmont streets. When tho change was mndo from horsepower to trolley, matters grow worse Then tho poles and tho tan glo of overhead wires mado that historic broikthlng spot look like a ploco of dingy, green billiard cloth which hod bocomo fray ed and tattered around tho edges. So after much wrangling In tlio legislature and courts It was decided to build tho subway and put tho trolley earn underground. A lurgo portion of tho work has already been accomplished and Boston is delight ed with tho result. Tho first thing a Uos ton man asks a visitor from New York, Chicago or clxowhcro is: ""Been through tho subway yctf Let's boo you haven't ono In your placo, have your"" It is, In fact, a triumph f engineering and well worth n v lslt. There aro threo open cuts whero tho trolley cars cntor tho subway. Ono is out on Trcmont street where Shawmut nvenuo comes In. Hero tho tracks from each of theso thorough- fares divo into tho tunnel.

Including tho inclines or open cuts, tho subway has a total length of IX miles nnd will contain about Hvo miles of truck. At present tho branch down Boylston street along tho Common sldo and tho main lino down Tremont to Park street aro iu oper ation. Tho Shuwmut avenuo branch and tho northerly end of tho main lino will bo finished within tho next eight months. Qround was broken for tho subway In April, 1805. Tlio sum appropriated was $T, 000, 000 ond, wonderful to relnto, tho transit commissioners soy that it Is proba ble tho cost will bo about $1,000,0U0 lot.8 than that sum. No great dltlicultles havo been encoun tered thus for In digging this big holo In tho ground. Of course thcro wcro count less sowers, water pipes, gus plinjs, olectrio wire conduits and tho llko and somo -10 Inch water mains at an incomenlcnt level proved rather hard to handlo, but no un expected conditions arose to delay tho work. Tho main trunk of tho subway runs under tho wldo walk or moll on tho cast side of tho Common, nnd when tho excavations wcro being mado (ho bones of hundreds of old Puritans were disturbed. This raised a howl of righteous Indigna tion, and tho sncretlness of tho long forgot burying ground was harped upon for weeks. But tho commissioners quieted the reverent patriots by collecting all tho bones and rclntorrlng them in tho holy ground of tho Common, wlthnnico monu ment to mark tho spot. Tho deepest point of tho subway Is on Boylston street, whero tho south bound tracks aro laid 80 feet below tho surface, but tho overage- depth is 14 feet. Tho tun nel Itself is a glunt boro with ribs of steel and casings of cement, asphalt, concrcto and masonry. Tho roof is a series of arches and tho lloor Is concave, with drains at tho bottom. As tho drains ore below tho lovel of tho sowers, pits havo boon established at Intervals, and when they aro filled with water automutlo elec trical pumps aro started, which empty them into tho sewers abovo. Perhaps you Imagine that Boston's sub way is a dark, damp, 111 smelling place. It Is nothing of tho sort. Tho entrances to tho stations nro handsome structures of etono, with glass roofs. Tho only fault to be found with them Is that thoy remind you of an old Grecian tomb at least that is what I thought of tho first time I saw ono. But thou you go down nn easy flight of wldo stone steps to n cheerful, brilliant ly lighted station. Everything is dazzling ly white. Tho bricks lining tho entranco nro of glazed whlto porcolain, tho mason ry arches nro pointed whlto and tho Iron pillars and supports nro covered with lm maculato whlto enamel. Incandescent and aro lights flash everywhere, and tho vista ahead through tho stretches of tho subway Is far from n ding' ono. It Is about tho leanest and noatcst holo In tho ground in existence and no doubt will bo kept so.

OVER 1,400 PEOPLE ARE DROWNED WHITE STAR LINER STRIKES AN ICEBERG, WHILE GOING AT FULL SPEED AT 1:25 MONDAY MORNING AND GOES DOWN IN LESS THAN AN HOUR. WOMEN AND CHILDREN WERE SAVED But Many Wealthy and Prominent M en Are Lost.The White Star liner Titanic, the world's great est steamship has gono down some 500 miles off Cape Race, with 630 of her 1,300 passengers and her full crew of 860 men on board. That the greatest catastrophe in marine history has oc curred to a vessel of their line is ad mitted by the oflicials of the White Star Steamship company In New York The liner Carpathia, the first vessel to come within sight of the Titanic, res cued all the Titanic's life boats in which were 670 persons most of them The Steamship Titanic. women and children. Many women and children, however, have perished. When the Carpathia reached the ill fated vessel no sign of life was to ho seen anywhere, the mountainous ocean swells giving much evidence to the stupendous disaster. Early reports stated that all the passengers and the crew of the Titanic had been taken off by the Allen liner's Virginian and the Parisian, and the Carpathia, but wireless message received here dis credit these reports in every detail No hope is held out at the offices or the White Star line that, any man on board has survived fo tell the story of the final sinking of the levithian, al though some of the women in the boats may have witnessed the sinking. Only by miracle, it is pointed out, could any person who stood by the ship escape the great vessel's power ful suction as she sank to the bottom. The Titanic carried the most notable list of passengers ever borne across the Atlantic by one vessel. Homecoming American tourist postponed their sail ing weeks ago so as to ride the new wonder of the season on her maiden voyage. Dispatches state that the Titanic went down at 2:20 o'clock Monday morning. The delay in the transmis sion of the news is attributed to the fact that all dispatches have been sub ject to difficult relays. The collision of the Titanic with an Iceberg is now known to have been a lieadon crash that occurred while the liner was proceeding little less MAJOR ARCHIBALD BUTT. than her best speed. She was a day ahead of her schedule and it is con sidered probable that an attempt to make a record-breaking voyage was the hope of her crew when she entered the ice field. Her forward plates were completely wrecked. A gaping wound opening below her water line and letting the water into her forward compartments. In the meantime the lifeboats were manned and into them were placed as many of the women and chil dren as they could hold. The boats were put off while there was yet some hope of saving the Titanic afloat until wireless could summon help. Later and more conservative es timates tell of great bravery on the part of the men passengers. There was a minimum of disorder. John Jacob Astor. who, with his bride, was returning from their long honeymoon abroad, saw his bride placed in a life boat safely away. Col. Astor was drowned. The work of getting the life boats away, the work of allaying the fears of the great crowd of pas sengers as much as possible, the work of keeping the pumps in opera tion and the engines throbbing—these tasks and countless others were direct ed by Captain Smith, the vener able commander of the Titanic, and before her advent the commander of J the Olympic who displayed almost su perhuman power of mind and body at the world's most horrible sea disaster, I crowned his long and honorable serv. j ice on the high seas. A wireless message from the Vir- | ginia states that the occupants of the small boats which she picked up have • been transferred to the Carpathia which is proceeding to New York. The Titanic struck the iceberg at 1:26 Sunday night and floundered at 2:20 Monday morning. At daybreak the Carpathia arrived on the scene and her passengers and crew brought the small boats with their precious human cargo into New York. The boats which rushed to the Ti tanic's aid found only the scattered life boats and a dismal scene of wreck age.","April 10, 1912: Titanic begins her maiden voyage."

They were unable to understand why thev had not received some dis- f latches from the Titanic. The follow ng statement was made by one of the Officers: ""Twelve hours have passed since the collision was reported to have taken place and we have heard nothing of the a- ident. It is most strange the Titanic's sister ship, Olympic, which has a wireless apparatus of sufficient strength to send a message across the Atlantic, has sent us nothing. The Olvmpic left here last Saturday and this morning is 360 miles away from the Titanic. The Olympic should be alongside the Titanic at 2 o'clock this afternoon. The Olympic has been no tified of the reported accident."" A wireless message from the Titanic received shortly after midnight an nounced the liner had struck an ice berg off the banks of Newfoundland and was in a sinking condition. Trans fer of the passengers to the life boats began at once. The accident occurred at 10:25 o'clock last night. Two hours later the ship's wireless apparatus, which had been working so badly as to permit of only intermittent and fragmentary messages, failed com pletely.

A reas curing feature was that the weather was calm and clear, and help only a few hours away. First S. O, S. Message. The Titanic's fii.st S. O. S. message was received by he Allan liner Vir ginian which, according to the posi tion given by thi Titamic's operator was not more than 170 miles away. The captain of the Vi-inlan at once start- ed his boat at full speed for the scene of the disaster announcing to his broth er officer on the bridge of the Titanic that the Virginian should reach him by 10 o'clock this morning. The Titan Ic's accident happened in latitude 41 -4d north, longitude 50 .14 west. This point is about 1,150 miles due east of New York city and 450 miles south of Cape Race. Newfoundland, wireless station. All the messages from the ship were relayed to the Cape Race wireless sta tion by the Virginia and forwarded by the Marconi company to New York city. The Titanic's twin ship, Olympic, which left New York last week, wa3 also in direct communication with tne sinking boat from a point 300 miles away and started at once for the scene.

The news paper offices were besieged early to- i day bv inquiries from hundreds of persons shocked by the fragmentary newspaper dispatches seen at the breakfast table but in the early morn ing hours there was nothing vital to add to the alarming reports from Cape Race. Something further was expected every moment, but there was nothing at hand to relieve the anxiety fhown in every quarter. Vice Presi dent P. A. S. Franklin of the Interna tional Merchant Marine, the highest official of the White Star line here, was one of the first to be notified of the reported disaster but it was only through the Associated Press that he learned of it, and for hours there after he could only experess his as tonishment at the news and his doubt that such a large and thoroughly pro tected ship as the Titanic could be in danger at sea. l-rpon hearing the first reports he spoke reassuringly, saying that only eight or ten hours before the White Star offices had received a wireless giv ing the liner's position. He was sure if she had met with any accident he would have heard from her promptly. ""We are absolutely satisfied even if she was in collision with an iceberg she Is in no danger,"" he said.","April 10, 1912: Titanic begins her maiden voyage."

IT was a distinctly representative gathering of business, professional and laboring men that packed Metro politan Temple yesterday afternoon when Mayor Phelan called the Chi nese Exclusion Convention to order.

All present seemed to be animated by one impulse, that of doing their utmost to secure the re-enactment of the Chinese exclusion act and thereby prevent the threatened In vasion of Mongol horclee to the peril and degradation of American labor. The gathering was of that character which lends weight to any public move ment and the conclusions of which are ac corded respectful consideration In legisla tive halls. The convention was not the outgrowth of political or partisan senti ment, but of the fear of the people of the State that the danger which menaces their advancement and prosperity might, unless strong measures were taken, be actually realized. In order that the peo ple of the East might understand how the communities on the ""Western confines of the continent feel concerning the un restricted immigration of Chinese into their midst, the convention was decided upon, and it is needless to say that the memorial which is to be adopted to-day will prove to be an unanswerable argu ment to those of the East, who, without the slightest knowledge of the blight- Borne characteristics of the Chinese, have df-clared open sympathy for the coolie hordes which are only awaiting the ex piration of the exclusion act in May next SENATOR PERKINS WOULD CO FURTHER. /T is our people who pay the taxes that have built up our splendid institutions, and we should draw the line furtJter, only this is not the time nor occasion.

https://guides.loc.gov/chronicling-america-chinese-exclusion-act,https://www.loc.gov/resource/46032385/1901-12-06/ed-1/,1,"The Yellow Peril. It will be necessary for the present congress to. take acjtion upon the Chinese exclusion act which expires by limitation May 24, 1902. The Kjansas City platform contained the following plank on the subject: We favor the continuance and strict en- forcement of the Chinese exclusion law and its application to the samo classes of all 'Asiatic races. This plank was unanimously agreed upon by the platform committee, and there was no dissent from it among the delegates. It is to be expected, therefore, that the proposition to extend the Chinese exclusion act will receive the support of all the democrats in the house and senate. The editor of The Commoner received a letter a few days ago from a democrat who complained that the laboring men of the Pacific slope had ignored the. Chinese question in the last campaign and suggested that it would only be a merited punish ment if the republican party refused to extend the exclusion act. It is not unnatural that some resentment should be felt toward those who sup ported the republican party in spite of the dangers which republican supremacy involves, and yet no one can justify himself in either supporting a bad policy or in failing to protest against it merely be cause the policy would punish .some who ought to have exerted themselves to prevent ij:. That many of the republican leaders are in favor of a ..policy, Jfcat will flood the country with cheap Chinese labor, is true, and that an imperial policy tends to lend encouragement to the cheap labor proposition, is also true, but the failure of the laboring men' to see these dangers in advance would not justify .democrats in remaining quiet on this subject, although the republicans are in ""power and are responsible for legislation. The Chinese question is one that effects the en tire country, not the Pacific Coast alone or the laboring men alone. It is true that the Pacific Coast would feel the evil effects of Chinese emigra tion first, and it is also true that the laboring men would come into immediate contact with oriental labor, but in its ultimate influence the subject touches all parts of the country and reaches all classes. The question is whether we are going to build up a strong, independent, upright and pa triotic people and develop a civilization that will exert a helpful influence on all the world, or whether we are going to be a greedy, grasping na tion, forgetful of high ideals and concerned only in the making of money. Chinese emigration is defended by two classes of people. First, by those, comparatively few in' number, who believe that universal brotherhood requires us to welcome to our shores all people of all lands. This is the sentimental argument ad vanced in favor of Chinese emigration. There Is no more reason why we should construe brother hood to require the admission of all people to our country than there is that we should construe brotherhood to require the dissolution of family ties. The family is a unit; it is the place where character and virtue and usefulness are developed, and from the family a good or evil influence ema nates. It is not necessary nor even wise that the family environment should be broken up or that ill who desire entrance should bet admitted to the family oircle. In a larger sense a nation is a family. It is the center for the cultivation of na tional character, national virtue and national use fulness. A nation is under no obligation to the outside world to admit any body or anything that would injuriously effect the national family; in fact it Is under obligation to itself not to do so. The influence of the United States will bo much more potent for good if we Temaln a homogeneous nation with all citizens in full sympathy with all other citizens. No distinct race like tho Chinese can come into this country without exciting a fric tion and a race prejudlco which will mako it moro difficult for us to exercise a wholesome influence upon the Chinese in China, not to speak of our in fluence on other nations. Let us educate tho Chinese who desire to learn of American institutions; let us offer courtesy and protection to those who come here to travel' and investigate, but it will not be of permanent benefit to either the Chinese or to us to Invite them to be come citizens or to permit them to labor here and carry the proceeds of their toil back to their own country. The second, and by far the larger class, em braces those who advocate Chinese emigration on the ground that it will furnish cheap labor for household- and factory work. There is no force In the argument that is made by some that it is diffi cult to secure girls to do housework. If domestic service is not popular as compared with other w.ork, it is because the pay is not sufficient to mako it attractive and the remedy lies in better wages. Labor can be secured for any and every honorable -position-when-the'i'4sufflcienfc-to'attratitr' and the demand for Chinese servants comes with poor grace from those who often spend on a sin gle social entertainment as much as a servant'3 wages would amount to in an entire year. At this time When skilled and intelligent American labor is able to compete in foreign markets with the cheapest, labor of the world, it is absurd to talk about the necessity for cheap factory hands. The increase in Japanese Immigration, or rath er importation (for large numbers of them are brought for specific purposes) has been referredto in a former issue of The Commoner. IWwas there suggested that the Japanese government would doubtless, if asked to do so, place restrictions upon Japanese emigration that would make it unneces sary for us to deal with the subject by legislation. This matter should at once be brought to tho at tention of the Japanese authorities, and unles3 sufficient and satisfactory action Is taken by the home government the Chinese exclusion act should be made broad enough to extend to Japanese of the same class. The subject of oriental emigration cannot be discussed without giving some consideration to the danger of cheap labor from the Philippine isl ands. It will soon be necessary to legislate on this subject. If the Filipinos are permitted to come here there is danger that the Philippine ques tion will become only second in aggravation lo the Chinese question. If, on the other hand, the Filipinos are prohibited from coming here (if a republic can prohibit the inhabitants of one part from visiting another part of the republic), will it not excite a just protest on the part of the Fili pinos? How can we excuse ourselves if we In sist upon opening the Philippine islands to the In vasion of American capital, American speculators, and American task-masters, and yet close our doors to those Filipinos who, driven from home, may seek an asylum here? TIio democratic party should take a strong and aggresslvo position on this question. It can afford to'oppoBO Chinese emigration and insist upon tho unity and homogoncousness of ""oiir nation. It can afford to Insist that Japanese la borers shall be treated the samo as Chinese labor ers and excluded, by agreement with tho Japanese government if possible, by congressional legisla tion if necessary. The democratic leaders should further point out that the Philippine question involves tho samo menace to our country, and that as wo can neither afford to admit tho Filipinos nor yet mako a dis tinction between different parts of tho republic, we should at once declare our purposo to give the Filipinos independence as soon as a stable govern ment can be established.","November 21-23, 1901: Chinese Exclusion Convention “demands” re-enactment of Exclusion Law to protect labor."

One of the big questions which is agitating thit country at tho present time is the Chinese exclusion act, and the effect its rigid enforcement has now and may have in the future, on American commerce and trade in China. The exportation of cotton and cotton goods to China has grov-n from almost nothing to $40,000,000 in a few yca-s. Other lines of exports to the celestial kingdom have shown very large gams. The American manufac turer is clamoring tor an open door to the trade of China. The American manufacturer has always been solf- ifsh and in most instances, been ready to sacrifice the good of the people to his own profit and selfish ends. It matters little to the manufacturer of cotton goods in New England or the south if the Pacific coast and adja cent territory is overrun with cheap Chinese coolies, the lowest strata of Chinese life. 5f he can find a ready and a profitable market for a few more millions of dollars of cotton goods and other products of his shops. 7""he cry for more liberal immigration Jiws for the Chinese comes wholly Irom the manufacturers. Tne people of the Pacific coast don't want the aan at any price. He is a men- ace to this country and his very pres ence exerts a contaminating in fluence. It is impossible for him to amalgamate with the people of this country. He can not become a citizen and ho has no desire to make this land of the free his home and reside here permanently. Personally he Is as objectionable as tho negro of the J south and if we must have cheap labor 1 let us give the negro a chance. ""We lave him with us and while he is not .as skillful as the Chinaman or as In dustrious, he Is by far the best cheap laborer in the world. The Chinese exclusion act has been in operation for more than twenty years. At tho time of its passage a perfect horde of orientals were streaming Into this country, over running the Pacific coast states, and drifting far back into the interior. The exclusion act stopped this unholy in vasion at once and the flow of China men began to go the other way. There were at that time more than a quar ter of a million Chinamen In the ""United States. During these twenty years this number has been on the gradual decline. Death has thinned tho ranks of the yellow skinned sons of the east and a large proportion of the Chinamen who were in this coun try have made their ""stake"" and re turned to China to remain. In San Francisco. Los Angeles, Portland and Seattle the gradual decrease in the number of Chinese has been most notable. It is doubtful if at the pros sent time there are 50,000 Chinese in the entire country, and the country will be infinitely better off when these, too, ""have folded their tents, like the Arab, and silently stolen away."" The manufacturers, for years, have kept an outrageous tariff on all classes of manufactured goods by their cry of ""protection to American labor,"" and they have filtched mill ions of dollars from the pockets of the people under the guise of a tariff to enrich their own. It matters not to them how heavy the burden on the shoulders of the people, just so they get their pound of flesh.

Cincinnati, Jan. 10.The case of Hong Wing against the United States, involving the Chinese exclusion act, was decided in favor of the United States circuit court of appeals in this city, the court holding that the act of .April 7, 1904, continued the exclusion act in full force, congress haying full potyer to dp so. Hong Wing is one of six Chinamen who had been ordered deported under the provisions of the Chinese exclu sion act and the cases being identical the one decision will apply to all six. Attorneys for the applicant main tained that the exclusion act was void and that their clients eould not be de ported. The decision was announced by Judge Richards, who said that the main point presented to the court was whether the act of April 7, 1904, con tinued the Chinese exclusion act in force and the court was satisfied that it did do so without reference to any existing treaties or regulations. The act was passed in view of the treaty expiring and it had continued the pro visions of the treaty. Congress has the power to modify, reject or concur in treaties and it had done what was wholly within its power in passing this act.

Asbklnll Con srqps to Pasil a stringent ExclusIon Act Agattist the, lioallants. The meeting at Assembly hall last night to discuss the 'Cbloese question was well attended by workingmen of Helena, J, E. Boncher presided and J. Y. Bennett was secretary, Chairman Boucher stated that all were no doubt aware that the Chinese exclusion act expired in May, and that a measure would be introduced in congress to continue the restriction. ""It is a matter of interest to us and to the business men of Helena,"" bhe said. ""I am surprised that there are not more basiness men present, But because there are eot more of them is no reason why we should not express our opinions."" L i. Glidea said the meeting had been called by him to take action on the peti tions to congress for the exclusion of the Chinese, and for the election of senators by the direct vote of the people, both of which were suggeted by T. V. Powderly. The seo retary stated that he had petitions on the Chinese question prepared for the signa tures of those present and for other work ingmen's organizations. It was decided to allow five minutes to each man to talk on the subject. As this was announced one mani present began a rambling speech about the uselessness of the Chinese to the mer chants, the doctors and the real estate men, and was proceeding to state that China had 44,000,000 people and the United States but 17,000,000, when the bhairman called him down with the remark that this was a meeting to discuss a serious problem, and not a ""josh."" The culprit took his seat, and, the discussion was taken up in a seri ons strdin. John Finn suggested that the working men would have to come out and let it be known to the politicians that whoever was not on their side could not get thir votes. F. A. Adrian said they could nothing un less they all stood together and refused to patronize the Chinamen or those who em ployed them. Adolf Halest thought the question a grave one, not only because the Chinaman worked for less than a white person, but because what money these people got was with drawn from the already inadequate circulr tion and taken back to their native land. Besides that there were the vices the Chi nrmen brought here, such as the opium habit. While it was impossible to get rid of all the Chinamen now here, it would be well to keep others from comine. Those now here would soon die out. He said the working people had to patronize the Chi namen for their garden truck because no white man raised any, but that would not be enough to keep them here. Chairman Boncher said the solution of the problem was a difficult one. It might do to take the almost unprecedented step of sending all the Chinamen back, but as that was well nigh impossible, the next great question was how to mitigate the evil and reduce it to the minimum. The exclusion -act did nrot remedy the disease. it was not heroic enough. It was wonder ful how, when congress passed a law, it was so easy to evade it. The people of the United States were most considerate of evil doers. It would seem that when any great wrong was committed it was neces sary for a certain class of people to get out and roar, and all the others called them agitators. Perhaps Dennis Kearney was an agitator, but he had a kick. No attention was paid to him, but when the trouble be gan to effect the upper classes, then congress took action. There were certain stores on Broadway occupied by Chinamen as mer chants. If the Chinman ever vacated the places the stores could never be rented to a white man for the same sum. That had been found out in Portland and San Fran oisco. But the Helena business men knew it all; they would not learn by experience. When the merchants began to feel the effect of the presence of the Chinese then the legislators would act. He feared they never would act on the appeal of the workingmen. ""I he only way I see is to pass an exclusion not that will last forever."" he continued. ""We must say to our legislators that this is the one thing we insist upon. The Knights of Labor have a clause in. their declaration of principles that no creed or color shall be prohibited from being members. The same is found in the constitution of the United Statee. Yet Jefferson and the other fram ers of the constitution never meant a lot of vampires and bloodsuckers should be ad mnitted who come because we have some thing they want, aeni who, when they get it, go back home to enjoy it. Our only way is to impress on the minds of the people who are in office and those who want to get there, that their present and further safety depends on the passage of an exclusion act that will last forever."" When the petition to congress was being passed around for signatures Mr. Gildea suggested taking up the senatorial question, but Michael Corbett thought that it would be bad policy to drop the Chinese matter at this point. He favored continuing to hold the meetines, but in a larger place. He also suggested withdrawing all patronage from the Chinamen. The quickest way to get rid of them is to lot them alone, Mr. Gildea said the Chinese question had been effectually disposed of so far as the present meeting was concerned. The question of electing senators by direct vote of the peo ple was eof as great, if not greater import ance than the Chinese question. The Chinese exclusion noact had been in force ten years, but it was a prohibition that did not prohibit. The other question was one of bringing the senato s closer to the people, where they conld,bo dealt with better and dic tated to in stronger terms than they could be now. Chairman Bouocher wanted another and a larger meeting with the business men present. liecretary Bennett did not have much faith in the business men attending. ""As an example of their duplicity, or policy,"" he said, ""you will re member that the council unanimously passed anti-Chinese resolutions. Four of ths men who voted for them employ China men in their houses. One told me it was because better service could be had from the Chinamen. The other said he would talk about it when the Burlingame treaty was rescinded."" Mr. Gildea then moved to take up the senatorial question.",No timeline found

A word or two about the new record holders at this time would not be out of place. in view of the wonderful feats which they have performed behind the throttle. Robert Burman, acknowledged ""speed king."" is but twenty-seven years old. Bom near Imlay City. iMich., In 1S84, Bur man lived on the farm until about ??v enteen years of age. Then he went to testing automobiles, and tested the first car ever made by the Buick Motor Com pany, when the factory was located at Jackson. Mich. iAter he entered the em ploy of the Jackson Automobile Company, and soon became head tester. While he was thus employed a freak racing car was built in Jackson, and the builder In vited Burman to a five-mile match race on the mile horse track at the fair grounds. Burman took the chance of be ing shown up. and won the race by al most a mile. This started the speed career of the pres ent monarch of them all After much per suasion and the ofTer to pay hit own ex penses if the company would let htm have a car he was allowed to enter a tifty-mile race at Detroit in 1106. All of the big bovs of the game were in, but Bob start ed out to ""beat it."" and won the race hands down. His next experience was to drive twenty-two and a half hours of a twenty-four-hour race In St. Louis the same year and win by eiKhty-two miles. Then the Buick company got him and his career which gained him the name of ""Wild Bob"" started. He was but twenty three years old, but he proved hi? ability and his nerve, and hip promotion was fast. A list of Burman's winnings would fill a fair-sized volume. His most notable victory of 1910 was first American car in the Savannah grand prize race and third in the race. He won several long races at the Indianapolis motor speed way in July, 1010, but the disqualification of the Marquette-Buick cars loscredits he gained by clever driving. Burman left the Buick team early this year to drive the cars formerly owned by Barney Oldfield. He immediately drove the Ji*-horsepower Blitzen Benz faster than Oldfield ever had dared, thereby breaking all records for the kilometer, mile and two-mile distances. The rec ords made by Burman in the Benz at Daytona April 1011, were: Kilometer, 15.88: mile. 25.40. and two miles, ftl.28. This is faster than man ever traveled be fore. Ray Harroun was born at Spartans burg. Pa., and is twenty-nine years old. He has driven in practically all of the great automobile races during the last three or four years. He holds a long list of records and has won many trophies. Harroun won more firsts than any other driver during 1010. Following are some of his records, regardless of class: 35 miles. 42:03.35; 60 miles, 45:51.72: 65 miles, 40:38.34: 7? miles, 53:25 24; 75 m'les, 57:15 70; 80 miles. 1:01:04.77; .85 miles. 1:04:53.12 00 miles, l:OH:412; H5 miles, 1:12:32.98; 100 miles. 1:16:21.9; 110 miles, 1:20:25; 12 miles. 1:37:18; 130 miles, 1:45:30: 140 miles, 1:43:57; 150 miles. 2:02:16; 160 miles, 2:10:54; 170 miles, 2:19:31: 1*0 miles. 2:2^:18; 19 miles. 2:37:09; 200 miles, 2:46:32.

Perhaps a number of manufacturers and o* tiers in the industry do rot fully realize what tiie Canadian reciprocity agreement means. It is of far greater importance t' the automobile industry than t'le avertge man imagines. The reduction of duty on American-made cars from 3.""? to :;o per cent opens up a wider channel for American goods to flow across the border, and brings a rich market for cars closer to our door. According to turer, Canada, within the next few years, will be buying loads of cars of the utility type for use in its vast grain re gion. When one stops to think that in the United States more than 80,000 farmers use automobiles, and that hair' of these are grain producers, who find noicr tars economical in their business, it is not difficult to foresee that Canada, with its enormous- grain industry, the vastne^s of wpich scarcely can le con ceived. shorti.* will follow suit and adopt the motor car en a much greater scale.","May 30, 1911 : The Indianapolis Speedway hosts its first annual 500-mile race on Memorial weekend.

The requirements of the en try conditions were much more strin--genlt The facilities for handling the largest number of people that will witness a sporting event in 1912 are much improved over the 1911 condi tions and Indianapolis people by co operating with the speedway man agement and the hotels will be able to easily handle all Its guests. The motor speedway, at a cost of $650,000, has substituted a tunnel for the old foot bridge just north of the pits. This will facilitate the hand ling of the autos that are parked In the infield and the vast crowds that will view the race from this enclos- lirp.

It will admit of thd pas sage of two motor cars at tbefaame time, going in opposite diraftions, and also provides two passages for pedestrians elevated above the ve hicle passages. The pits at the south end where Harry Knight pushed his Westcott into the wall to escape crushing the Case mechanician, Anderson, last year, have been fitted with concrete walls like the other' pits in place of the former wooden partitions. The speedway has in every way perfected its arrangements to make safe every possible angle of the, race. The track has been gone over care fully and smoothed 'out. The driv ers were instructed Monday night at 8 o'clock, in a meeting at J:he Clay pool hotel by the A. A. A. officials in charge of the race, and cautioned to be vigilant at ""all times. An elaborate signal system for use in emergencies on the track has been worked out. 2 mm Cottolene is a vegetable product without an nmc m it.

Not only will the race for 500 miles be the longest track,, event in 1912, but it will also offer the largest amount of cash to the drivers of the modern spaceaters. Fifty thousand dollars is offered to these men who will catapult their cars through space for more, than six hours in an effort to cross the Jape first with 200 laps to their credit. The winner will receive for his probably six and one-half hours' ex ertion, the modest sum of J20,U00, while Ray Harroun, the winner of the-first race, drew down 10,000.

To be j sure, much sympathy was expressed fc De Palma. who lost the $10,000 puree when victory seemed certain, but the j fact that an American built car came j in the victor and set a new world's j record overshadowed the misfortune of i De Palma and his Mercedes and aroused I THE SAN FRANCIJStJO^OAI^L/ FiiIDAY, MaY 31, 1912. the truly patriotic enthusiasm that goes with Amerlpan success. Interest in the race was at a hlfb pitch throughout the six hours it was being run, and the bulletins that drifted from the race course telling of the shifting of places among the fast mov ing cars were devoured with keen eagerness. Most of the principal cars in the big race are represented here and the headquarters for the respect ive machines were the centers for emwds of zealots who gathered to learn of the progress of the race. That a new world's record was set was not a surprise, for it was gen erally conceded that the entries this year were the faatest cars that were ever matched. The victory of tRe Na tional car was also no particular sur prise, for the car was frequently men tioned as one of the most probable winners, judging from the fast time the entries were making in the tryouts. At the headquarters of the Howard Automobile company, distributer* for the National, the news of the victory was received with wild delight.

To build, for the especial use of an automobile tour, a stretch of road over seventy miles in length, traversing a country that has heretofore been acces sible only to pack animals, is the unique feat of a body of public-spirited residents of northern Arizona. The new road connects the railroad of Ash Fork with the government reserva tion at Grand Canyon. The tour for which it was constructed Is the first of Its kind, including, as it does, an aggre gation of over sixty Studebaker cars, nearly all of which are owned in Phoenix, the Arizona metrppolis. When the tour was first announced it was the intent of the Phoenix men to drive their cars to the canyon by a rough roundabout route, following the lines of the Santa Fe railroad by way of Wil liams. Hut the citizens of Ash Fork ob jected. They readily appreciated the fact that their own town was missing a fine chance to show itself to advantage on the map. A committee accordingly told the Phoenix people that they would guar antee a more direct route via Ash Fork. Then they went to work with their picks and shovels, working out half-way, where they met a similarly public-spirited pang of road builders from Grand Canyon, who had laid out the second half of the trail. The whole Job was under the direction of the veteran ""BH1"" Bass, who has lived in the Grand Canyon country since be fore the days of the railroad, and lie has been locally credited on many occa sions with having dug the himself. This feat Mr. Bass modestly denies. The Studebaker Flanders ""20."" path finder tor the tour, recently made the trip to the canyon over the new road. Though the car carried tive men and their baggage, the run was easily made at an average speed of nearly twenty miles an hour. The entire distance over the new road longed slightly more than seven ty-three miles. About half was typical desert country, inhabited by prairie dog-s. coyotes, a few antelope and an immense herd of wild horses. The other half is similarly arid, but rather mountainous. For more than twenty five miles the road follows a tortuous valley. There is no human habita tion between Ash Fork and Grand Canyon, and not a single well or stream of water, except in the rainy season, now several months past.","May 28, 1912 : Joe Dawson wins in Indianapolis with the added benefit of increased prize money.

Starter Root ordered all of the cars on the track at 9 o'clock to test out the emergency brakes. While going at high speed In the home stretch, the signal for the emer gency brakes was given and each car had to stop within a short distance. Other officials were busy at the pits checking up the driver, mechanicians and pit helpers as only a limited num ber were allowed in each pit. Race Starts. Promptly at 10 o'clock te 27 cars, led by Carl G. Fisher, millionaire sportsman, began the long race around the two and a half mile track, amid the cheers of thousands and the waving of flags of five nations. The cars got away with a flying start and were going 50 miles an hour as they came down the. long home stretch. Jenkins' Schact was the first car to stop at the pits. The machine blew a right rear tire. He lost a lap by the stop. Before Jenkins started again, An derson's Stutz drew up at the pits with the same trouble. Ralph De Palma, in a Mercer, dropped out of the race on the eigh teenth lap, on account of cylinder trouble. He was soon followed by Jenkins' Schacht, which broke a crank case in the twentieth lap. Kerr's Stutz broke a clutch re lease in the back stretch and caught fire. He was out of the race. No one was injured. The boiling hot sun caused consid erable tire trouble and one car after another dropped in at the pits for a change. Burman Breaks Records. Speedway, Indianapolis, May 30. Burman, in a Keeton,, leading for the first 100 miles, broke all speedway records for that distance. His time aws 1:15:50.55. The former record was 1:23:43.11.

Foreign Driver's Time for 500 Miles Is 6 Hours, 31 Minutes, 43.45 Seconds, an Average of 76.59 Miles an Hour. Indianapolis, Ind. Jules Goux, driv ing a Peugot car, over which waved tho flag of France, won the 500 mile Memorial Day race here. His time was G hours, 31 minutes, 43.15 seconds, an average of 76.59 miles an hour. His rewards were internation al honors, cash prizes worth $35,000, including the $20,000 cash prize of fered by the management of tho speedway for the winner of the race, a kiss from a dirt covered mechani cian and a shower of champagne made of grapes that grew in the coun try whence he came. Wlshart Second In Contest. Spencer Wlshart, who drove a Mer cer car into second place at the finish of the race, was given a kissless and champagneles8 reception at the Mer cer pits, but his two hands, worn out by the steady work at the wheel of his car, were shaken wildly by a hun dred admirers. He was lifted upon the shoulders of his pit men and cheered with the enthusiasm equal to that accorded to the Frenchman. He was given a check for ?10,000. One of the most remarkable bits of race car driving was staged by Charles Merz In his Stutz car when he drove three and one-half miles, more than one lap around the course, with his car ablaze beneath the en gine and his mechanician and himself hardly able to keep their seats on ac count of the flames that were licking at their legs. Merz was watched on his lap by the breathless thousands who feared his car would explode or that he would be driven from tho wheel by the ilameB. Displaying al most unbelievable nerve, he waved acknowledgement of the green flag, flashed over him by Starter Root as ho crossed the finish line for tho next to the last time and settled Into the hot seat of his car for tho final lap. Races With Car Ablaze. Spectators remaining in the grand stands and bleachers were on their feet straining for a glimpse of tho intrepid young Indianapolis driver as rounded the last curve and started down tho final Etrotch with tongues of flames spurting from under tho hood of his car. He could not havo mado another lap. His car would have gone to pieces in another mile. But it remained intact and continued to do his bidding until It limped across tho finish lino and Merz was $5,000 wealthier.

This is a question that has often been asked but seldom answered. Each year thousands of automobiles are manufactured and sold and thou sands are discarded to the scrapheap. Like all pieces of expensive machinery, the automobile winds up its career of usefulness by being sold for old Junk. Tho engines are often sold to second hand dealers, who utilize them for many different purposes. Many of tbe automobiles purchased years ago by El Pasoans-have long since found themselves in the discard, while others have burned, up. Perhaps the oldest car In point of service now owned In El Paso is a Rambler, pur chased in 1904 by Charles Rader. This car has traveled more than 100.000 miles and Is today being used by Mr. Rader. The car is now nearly 15 years old and has seen hard service over the highways of the southwest Fred Woodworth, of the EI Paso Lumber company, has a two cylinder TiiHupitioliile CKf T--JE- ArCAA-T WL V Jk.....i...1''MijJFBjgottff $1365 F.

Protect the Family In Bad Weather Everybody knows the Hupmobile has long been the car of the American family. Now it is the winter car of the American family, because the Sedan top gives the family com plete protection, says the Lone Star Motor Co., the local Hupmobile dealer. I'd like you to see the car with the top fitted, be cause I'm pretty sure you will want one for your own family. The extra cost is so small that it is out of all proportion to the comfort afforded and the colds and doctor bills it prevents. N Its appearance is handsome it harmonizes per fectly with the 1915 Hup's beautiful lines it is sub stantially built and firmly, though temporarily, attached.

This car has probably traveled further than any lit tle car ever owned In the southwest. It is still being used by Mr. Woodworth to drive daily to and from the office. Kl Paso's First Anto. The first automobile ever brought to El Paso was owned by the late Frank Bell, who brought it here in 1901. He purchased the car from the Locomobile factory and it was a great curiosity to the residents of El Paso. Every time Mr. Bell appeared on the streets with the machine a large crowd would gather to inspect the new form of lo comotion. The automobile was only in Its infancy when Mr. Bell purchased the car and he did not find it much of a pleasure conveyance. As a rule the ma chine was seldom taken from the garage without balking a short dis tance down the street The machine burned up in a fire about a year after Mr. Bell purchased it. The First Electric. The first electric automobile ever brought to El Paso was purchased by Felix Martinez. He states that he pur chased the car about 1899 to be used as a delivery car for the Daily News, since absorbed by The El Paso Herald. But, like the Locomobile owned by Mr. Bell, the electric was anything but a success as an automobile. Mr. Martinez, in speaking of the car recently, laughing, said that the machine only moved Tlen someone had his shoulder against it and seldom moied on its own locomo tion. After several experiments with the machine, he abandoned it, and finally gave it to some boys who soon destroyed it The electric cost Mr. Martinez $2700 Roads Too Rough. J. A. Smith purchased one of the first gasoline automobiles in the city. It was a failure, principally because of the rough roads and streets at that time, and he finally sold it to a Mexi can and the car has long since been in the scrap heap. The car was a Cadillac and the ton noau opened in the back, the passen gers stepping up as in an omnibus. The seats were on either side and in the back corners There were many other automobiles purchased from that time until 1907, but there were few of the cars that were successes. In 1907 the state paBsed the automobile license law and all motorists In the county owning ma chines had to havo them registered. This is the first record obtainable of El Paso automobiles. The first automobile license Issued in 1907 by Park Pitman, county clerk, was taken out by Dr. Frank Thatcher. He secured the license on August 1, for a Holsman automobile, a small runa bout He still 1ms the car and drives it each day The machine has seen seven years of continual service. Quits Engine, for Auto. ""Billy"" Davis, a former railroad en gineer, on the 30th day of August 1914. took out the third automobile .license. This was his second car, however. His first one he purchased In 1902, when he gave up his position at the throttle of a locomotive and put the first public car into service in El Paso. Mr. Davis has been driving a public machine since that time. His first car was a Cadillac; his second an Oldsmoblle. The fourth automobile license Issued by the county clerk was taken out by W. B Latta for a Reo touring car. Mr. Latta states that he sold the machine a lear later, but docs not remember to whom. 1 Transmission Still Good. J. A. Krakauer took out the fifth au tomobile license, for a four cylinder Premier. He drove the car for several years and later tore it down The transmission is now being used to shift machinery in the shops of Krakauer, Zork Moye, sucrs. The frame of the (Continued on Kext PaeeJ Entry Blanks For Indianap olis Event Out; Foreign Cars ""Will Be on List. Indianapolis, Ind., Dec 5. Entry lists for the next Indianapolis 500 mlle race. May 29, are now open, S00 entry blanks having been sent out to manufacturers of cars and private owners here and abroad. Despite the war. It is thought the contest will be most successful, plenty of material being available on both sides of the Atlantic Italy alone is expected to furnish no less than six machines. Changes in the specifications for the Indianapolis contest are numerous, the chief of these being the reduction of motor dimensions bv one-third, or from 450 to 300 cubic inches, and the raising of the speed minimum to 80 miles. With much smaller machines better results are demanded. This Is the chief utilitarian function of the racing game. The number of starters has been raised to 23, as compared with 30 of ears previous. This Is the full ca pacity alloted the track under the rul ings of the American Automobile as sociation, which specify a limit of one car to everj 400 feet of track. Speed trials to determine the final field will be held 10 days ahead of the race, In the inverse order of en try, the fastest 33 being eligible. In the event of more than three cars of one ""make entering, the fastest three will be admitted. This Is to eliminate the speedway from wrangles between factories and private owners desiring to enter cars of the same make In ex cess of the A. A. maximum. Cars will line up for the start In the order of the time made in the speed trials, the fastest car starting in first position, next the pole. Racing num bers will be issued on the same plan, the fastest car receiving No. 1. This is to avoid the possibility of a spill during the flying start, when a slow machine in front would be in the why. The color of cars will be according to international usage, i. e, Germany, white; Belgium, yellow; France, blue; Italy, red, and America, red and white. In previous years Individual combina tions have been employed, at times to the great amusement of the spectators. Regulations as to the physical con dition of drivers and the mechanical soundness of cars will be more rigid ly enforced next year than ever be fore The front axles of all machines must thus be entirely new two days before the race This is to guard against possibility of accident, due to crystallization or other defect Any car spilling an excess of oil on the track, will, for like reasons, be dis qualified. The Dawson-Gilhooley accident of last year has caused chain-driven cars to be barred from the track, Unless the chains are adequately though not necessarily fully enclosed. Gllhooley, it will be remembered, came to grief because a bursted tire caught between his chain and gears, rendering his car beyond control, due to the action of his differential. This accident was not as has so often been stated, traceable to incompetence on Gilhooley's part Prizes remain substantially ths same, $60,000 being split 10 ways among the winners, with $20,000 first money.- The intermediate trophies, however, including the G. J. trophy, the Remy trophy and brassard, the Prest-O-Lite trophy, and the AVheeler Schebler cup, will not be withRVld If their winner falls to go the entire dis tance of 500 miles, as formerly, but it will be awarded regardless of their owner's status at the finish. This, It is thought, will speed up the race a great deal.","May 27, 1913 : Jules Goux, a Frenchman, takes the win with cash prize and champagne shower."

There is something In that game of whizz and thrill that causes meu to forget; to Ignore all past injuries; and to risk, their lives again and again. When the big squad of the fastest drivers ln the world gets the word to go Monday at Indian apolis at least 20 men who have escaped death narrowly, who have been broken and torn, who have been hurled through the Ur, who have fried under burning, overturned wreckage of great racing machines, will shoot away from the mark. In the van will be Joe Dawson who, a year ago on that same track was hurled through the barriers, burned under the wreck age of his burning car and dragged out cut and torn beyond recognition. They are strange beings, these fellows who risk limb and m-yi for money and sport. Ralph De Palma, now premier driver of the world, has been known at once as the luckiest and unluckiest driver. His worst accident wan the crash at Mil waukee in 1912, when near the finish he had a mixup with Caleb Bragg that spoiled one of the greatest finishes of auto racing. Bragg is a man worth perhaps $5,000,000 who races for the thrills. He is ln this race. Even recent accidents seem to have little effect. Tom Alley went through a fence; Ed O'Don nell crashed into the fence and was turned over; Ed Pullen, who was badly hurt a year ago, mixed In another accident ln the Van derbilt this year aud escaped with slight injuries—and all are back to risk more of the same as smil ing and fearless as If nothing ever went wrong. John De Palatna has had a dozen bad spills, even though this is his first really big race. He is a brother qL the faniojs Ralph and the majority of his ac cidents have happened on the small ""bush"" tracks. Dario Resta, the wild man, had a terrible accident at Brook fields. was in a had smashup at Berlin and a worse one at Rome, but drives as if he never knew a car could turn ovtrr. Bob f_iir.ii.-iti has faced death many times. Perhaps his narrow est escape was in 1912 when ""its car blew out both roar tires at the same instant. The machine was hurled into the air, turned three somersaults, and alighted a smoking mass of twisted steel—• with Burnian underneath and .ie crawled out without dangerous Injuries.

EARL HAMILTON, the left-hander who won six consecutive pames for the Pittsburgh Pirates this spring, and then en? listed in the United States Navy, used to Bay of ""Stuffy"" Mclnnis, then first baseman of the Philadelphia Athletics: ""If a left-hander should place a baseball in a burglar-proof box and try to sneak it across the plate in the middle of the night he'd find 'Stuffy* Mclnnis there waiting to hit. There's one bird who lives in luxury off left-handers. He can hit anything they pitch."" We observe that ""Stuffy"" broke it up yesterday. Vaughn passed Shean, Whiteman blew himself to a single and then Mclnnis. catching one of ""Hippo"" Vaughn's southpaw shoots, firmly laced it to left field for the single that scored Shean and gave the Red Sox the first game. It appears that this Beries is going to run to form. Victory Was Merited 'fHE Cubs should have won, you say, but shoul dthey? In the first, 1 third, and sixth innings they had men In scoring positions. A single would have scored two runs and beat the Sox in two of these innings; in the other the score would have been tied. But Pick, Paskert and Deal couldn't deliver the essential wallop when the time came. Base? ball is, more than anything else, a matter of doing the right thing at the right time. Mclnnis did that Pick, Paskert and Deal didn't. Ruth in the supreme test surpassed Vaughn, even though the pitching figures would indicate that Vaughn had the better of an exceedingly interesting duel. The assertion that Chicago should have won merits specific qualification. Ruth Is Boston's Ace THE Red Sox, always a ""money team,"" are legitimately jubilant. At worst they will come back to Boston with one victory and two defeats. More of such excellent pitching and they will do better. Should they win two games and lose but one in Chicago they will be the long enders in whatever betting is done after the third game. But the jig isn't up with Chicago. Far from it. Vaughn meas? ured up to expectations and proved that the Sox do not relish first class southpaw pitching. Mitchell has Tyler in reserve and he can shoot Vaughn back in the third game if necessary. It remains to be seen if Bush or Mays, right-handers, can do as well against the. Cubs as Ruth did. Ruth is a great personality on a ball field. A giant in stature, resolute of purpose and with a wonderful ""single-track"" brain, re represents almost the ideal athlete for competitive effort under groat -Tain. Bush and Mays are not Ruth's equals in tem? perament. , Fielding Rather a Surprise I THE fielding was a surprise. There were no errors, but neither were there hard chances. Chicago hit the ball into the air in the pinches and it is a bit early for any one to pull a Snodgrass. The Cubs' steck might have soared had the ball been hit on the ground and at one of Boston's ""green"" infielders. Likewise the Cubs ac? quitted themselves with honor in the field, but few of their plays, too, were made under strain. It is an old superstition that the team which wins the first game takes the series in this play. But it doesn't follow that there can't be exceptions to what has iUogically come to be regarded as a rule. The Sox met the rest best yesterday, but more of the Vaughn type of pitching and the Curs cannot fail to come through.

Incidentally, hie speech shows him to be quite in ccord with many others who think little of their plighted faith. Though ;? has two more years to complet? his contract ?with the Boston Red ex at a salary of $10,000 yearly. Ruth would sign a new one calling ?7T $20,000 yearly. Furthermore, he says he will not play with the Boe ra club unless his wishes are granted. . Last spring Ruth held out until the last minute. He wanted a alary of $15,000, if our memory be correct, but finally compromised by ?ft?ing a three-year-contract calling for a salary of $10,000 yearly. All oat took place before he began hammering home runs until he had Token ail previous big league records for this stunt. He admitted that e was satisfied with the treatment given him by both Harry Frazee and Jd Barrow. He proved it by playing fine ball all season. But Babe has '?gtened to -erpent tongues. Now he would quit playing ball unless the ?oston club agrees to make a new contract calling for $20,000 a year. The Joke of the sltuatioa is that tarry Frasee la In pretty much of a "" ?

If the estimate proves accurate, the sale of Ruth not only ele vates the trading of baseball players to inclusion in the category of sugar, shoes, clothing and other high-priced necessities, but records a sale at more than double the highest price heretofore paid for a player. When Alexander and Killifer were traded from Philadelphia to Chicago, $55,000 changed hands.

Hodges, The Wc!l-Knnivn Phyticitt. AST Mason ""I' .abe"" Ruth broke all baseball records by hitting twenty* nine homo runs. Ar.l this season there is every indication that ho will beat his 11*10 total by a wide margin. What is tho se ret of Ruth's ability to make home runs with such surprising fre quency? ?; it because he Is possessed of greater strength than his fellow players? Is it because his vision is keener or his museles better ca-ordinated? All these tilings doubtless have some thing to lo with it, but the real reason for thl:- iii.yionn'nal series of home runs sci i nee finds to be the way Xvitlx applies to his work with the bat certain well-known principles of physics and psychology. ""But."" you say. ""Iluth Is a ball plavor. What does ho know of physics or psy chology?"" Notheing, perhaps, but whether con sciou.ly or unconsciously Ruth applies certain well-known principles of these two sciences every time ho makes a homo run. Let us consider some of the many inter rsting scientific factors involved in bat t itig a ball. As very follower of baseball knows, a home run is the knocking of the ball out of the reaoli of opposing players and in .r.uch a direction and to nuch a distance as o make its return impossil'o before th? runner completes the circuit of the bases. Viewed as n mechanical proolem. the hit ting of a home run moans simply hitting t)i ball with the bat so as to give it great speed in the proper direction. The spe^l and direction which the bat can To made to give tilt; ball depend on the degree of tin curve which tlio pitcher has imparted to the ball, the weight of the ball, the. weight of the bat, the elasticity of the ball and bat. and the angle at which tin, ball iir pinges on the bat. The speed which a ball t * es on im mediately after its collision w'th the bat is a little difficult to compete because neither the bat nor the ball is perfectly elastic or perfectly non-elaaMc. To illus trate tlio difficulty of such a o mputation let mo explain what happens when per fectly elastic and perfectly non-elastic bodies come into collision. If two inelastic bodies?say two pieces of lead?of equal weight and going with equal speed, but in opposite directions meet squarely ""in mid-air, they will both stop and fall to the ground, all theii energy of motion having been turned into heat. If, however, perfectly elastic bodler of the same weight going with the same velocity, but in opposite directions, mee? in mid-air, they will bounce back with the same velocity they had originally. 11 one of these bodies has twice the velocity of the other, the latter will bounce back with twice its original velocity and tho former will bounce back only half as fast. All this applies to bodies having tho same weight. Whenever one of the colliding bodies is heavier than- the other, the ve locity given tho latter body upon bouncing is enormously increased. The bat which ""Rabe"" Ruth wields and the ball which he hits are both fairly clas tic; therefore, everything else being equal, the ball will be driven farther the heavier the bat and the faster the bat is moving as it hits the ball. Also, as tho weight of ""Halm"" Ruth' s body prevents his bat from doing much bouncing back, tho faster the ball corner, the farther It will go when ho hits it. The weight of tho ball Itself is a very important factor in hitting a homo run, viewed us a scientific problem. If thero k xt V ~ ~v~- ?""~ ""f Diagram Showing How the Difficulty of Following the Ball (B) crease* aa It Approaches Nearer, and Nearer to the Batter'* Eyo (A), the Angle at Which It I* Viewed from Positions 6 and 7 Being Ten Times as Great as That from 1 to 2. were no atmosphere, everytliine be ing equal, the lighter tne Dall happened to ho the farther it would go. The friction of the air. however, slows the ball up con siderably, and this fact has to bo taken into consideration with several others. The conclusion which science reaches Is that the heavier tho ball is, without In creasing its size or decreasing Its elas ticity, tho farther it will go after being struck with tho bat. The direction taken by a batted ball is affected to some extent by the rotation of tho ball as it strikes the bat. Thi3 factor is of the neatest importance when the but does not strike tho ball squarely. It is possible for the hat to hit the ball in such a way that it actually increases the latter's rotation. In other words, it is per fectly possible for the batter to hit tho ball in such a way that it takes on a de cided curve. Everybody who plays golf knows what a common occurrence this is on the links. A golf hall when struck acci dentally oft' centre will ofton describe the weirdest imaginable path through the air, particularly if it passes through various air currents. A honr n depends to a very large ex tent up ? direction given the batted ball. T ' ortanco of this factor 'may he estimated a- nine times that of tho speed given the hat*~d ball. 13y direction we mean not only the horizontal angle, but also the vertical angle at which tho ball leaves the hat. For example, no matter how hard the ball is hit, it will never re sult in a home run unit's .""t clears the upstretched arms of the p1 ?yers in tho field. It is plain that the direction given the butted ball must depend to a largo extent upon the manner in which the ball is travelling before it meets tho bat. Pro vided the ball is given a proper rota tion on its horizontal axis by the pitcher, the kind of curve best suited to make it difficult to hit it at the proper vertical angle is either tho down shoot or the up shoot. On account of the many variablo factors concerned science believes that any home run made with either of theso curve3 is a lucky chance pure and simple. After the ball has boon set in motion by the bat with a certain speed, tho distance it will go depends upon the vertical angle at which it starts. The most desirable angle i3 one of 12 degrees with the ground, or about half a right angle. Other factors which determine the distance a batted ball will travel are the speed of the ball, its sphericity, the smoothness of its surface and its lack of rotation. Tho greater tho speed of the ball tho more perfectly spherical it is. tho smoother its surface and the less rotation with which it travels the farther it will go. Atmospheric con ditions, of course, enter into tho problem. A ball will go farther in a clear air that is free from moisture. Tho wind may carry it bodily for quite a distance or may retard its progress. If science wore asked to make it difficult or well-nigh impossible for ""Babe"" Kutli to Ltit a home run it would select a day w.ien tho barometer was high, with the air so heavy with moisture that it would retard the progress of tho batted ball. Iho pitcher selected would be one good on very alow but curvy downshootfl. If such a pitcher were not available, one who hid euch great speed that lie couid put any kind of a ball over the plato for tho batter would bo chosen. With this hind of a pitcher the ball is likely to be hit behind the plate and unlikely to bo started on its course at the proper angle. His hitting of a homo run could then bo mado stHI more difficult by compelling the redoubtable ""Babe"" to use a bat either so heavy that he could not swing it with much speed, or so light that it would tend to hit tho ball at tho wrong horizontal angle. There is a certain spot on the bat, usu ally a few inches from tho end. but vary ing with dlfVerent bats, which science knows as the centre of percussion. If the ball hits the bat exactly on this spot tho greatest effect is produced. All ball play ers are aware when the ball hits this spot on the bat, not only through the absence of jar to the arm, but also through a pecul iar satisfaction which is hard to define, but which is no doubt physical as well as mentnl. ""Babe"" Ruth's phenomenal home run rec ord is largely due to tho fact that, con sciously or unconsciously, he has found a way of producing the collision between his bat and tho ball on this centre of per cussion more frequently than any other player. What is called the centre of percussion is a principle that enters into the design not only ot baseball bats, but of all things designed for men to swing. In the ham mer, for example, the centre of percussion should be in the head. If the tool is not designed so that this centre is properly located the hammer is unsatisfactory to use because it jars and tires tho am too much. The problem of hitting homo runs with the surprising frequency that ""Babe"" Ruth does is ono more complicated in the mat ter of powers of Judgment and observa tion involved than in mechanical prin ciples. Viewed as a mechanical problem, tho home run requires a bat just as heavy as a player can use with comfort, tho bat to bo given a motion as fast as possible when hitting the ball, and striking the ball so that it wilt ho impelled into tho air at an anglo of approximately 42 de grees or half a right angle. The ball should also, of course, be hit at such a horizontal angle as not to cause a foul. T^lio weight of the batter has very little to do with tho matter of home runs, hut his arm muscles are a controlling factor to the extent of, say, fifty per cent. Of course, If his arms are rigid enough to make tho bat for all practical purposes a part of his body when he hits the ball, and if his body is swung forward at just that instant, it Is possible that a heavy batter, all other things being equal, would be able to knock the ball farther than a lighter player.

Homo nins append, to a considerable de gree, on quickness of tlio eyo and a speedy response of tlio body's muscles to tho messago which tho eye Hashes to tho brain. To follow tho ball as it leaves the pitcher's hand is no easy matter, as tho sphere is often travelling at the rate of lf0 feet a second, or nearly two milos a minuto. The eye movement necessary to follow it increases greatly as tho ball draws nearor and nearer the plato, owing to tho in crease in the angle of vision which, by the time the ball is over tho plate, is about ten times what it was when it left tho pitcher's hand. As 1 have said, tho pitcher often hurls the ball at the rato of 150 feet a second. But tho ball is travelling much faster than that when it leaves ""Babe"" Ruth's bat after being hit for one of tho home runs that have made him famous. This is in accordance with the laws of tho impact of clastic bodies. Great Driluin RiffUts Hcaoiveil. to Raise a 55-Ton Locomo tive Half a Foot. All otlicr things being * equal, tho fnstor a ball la thrown the farther it can bo batted. You can prove \ this to your own satisfac tion by throwing a ball ngainst n brick wall. Tho faster it travels, tho hard , er it hits tho wall and tho farther it will bounce back. Of courso, If it Is raining when one of ""Babe"" Ruth's long hits is made, the drops of water striking tho ball will bring it to the ground long before it otherwise would fall. Tho rain also makes the ball heavier, and as It contains only so much energy to k start with, it will bo \ slowed up in its flight on account of some of tho L?rIL.? energy being used to give tho captured rain drops their new velocity. flow much actual energy does ""Babe"" Ruth expend in hitting one of his home fns? Tho activity or horsepower involved 1* very great, but it is in operation only for tho"" fraction of a second. The ball which ""liabe"" Ruth hits for a V e run weighs about tivo ounces. If n % at gives it a velocity of 500 feet a see on.., wo find, by applying a well known formula of physics, that 1,200 foot pounds of actual energy or work is done. Now, if it takes Ruth one-twentieth of a second to impart this energy by a swing of his bat, this would be at tho rate of 24,000 foot pounds a second, which is about forty-four horsepower. Tho king of homo run makors Is then working at tho rate of forty-four horse power evory time ho cracks out one of hla long hits, but he maintains this rate for such a brief length of time i.hat not very much actual work is involved. Hut if the energy exerted by ""Babo' The Horse-Power Required to Make Fifty of ""Babe"" Ruth's Home Runs Would Be Suffi cient Ruth In all the homo runs he has made up to lato coulil ho collected into a singlo forco it would he a vory enormous thing. Twenty-nine such runs last season and moro than a score thus far this year? this would he the equivalent of more than 2,000-horsepower?enough if exerted bo hind a gigantic bat to demolish a building like Now York's Metropolitan Tower! Of course, there are many psychological as well as mechanical factors involved in the hitting of tho long scries of home runs which ""Babe"" Ruth has been making for two seasons. The batter must bo able to ""sense"" in some manner not yet fully un derstood just about what kind of ball the pitcher is going to throw. Then he must bo capable of putting his body in readiness with lightning swiftness to meet that kind of ball when it passes over the plate. Tho player's Judgment about tho bull must bo made within tho smallest fraction of a sec ond after it leaves tho pitchpr's hand. Through some queer sixth sense?tne kinaesthotic sense, as psychologists call it ?all batters have tho feeling as to whether the trnll tho pitcher is about to throw is go ing to pass over the plato or not. In tho average batter the impressions conveyed by this sixth sense caunot be more than 50 per cent accurate, but in the case of ""Babe"" Ruth, as his batting record shows, they must be about 90 per cent accurate. As everybody who plays baseball or ever watches a game knows, you can't strike out and make a homo run. and the player can seldom hit a home run unless the bail ha strikes is taking a course that would havo carried it straight across the plate unless Interrupted by his bat. This, then, is the secret of ""Babe"" Ruth's home runs as viewed from a scien tist: standpoint. A highly developed kin aesthetic sense enables him to ""sense"" the kind of ball the pitcher is going to throw. When a ball rotating on Its horizontal n.\is and curving most favorably for his purpose comes along he swings his bat at it with an energy sufficient to chango its direction and greatly increase its velocity. The bat Is swung in such a way that the centre of percussion meets the ball, send ing it upward at an angle of 42 degrees and not too far to the right or the left. When all these things happen the result should bo a home run, provided that the pitcher has given the ball proper speed and that tho wind and other atmospheric conditions aro favorable.","July 1920 : Physicist A.L.

O. McGeehan IF THE lata lamented Shakes? peare were a' baseball writer he might usa a line that he wested upon some more or less obscure hero of antiquity and say of ""Babe"" Ruth, ""He doth bestride the narrow baseball fields like a Colos? sus."" For ""Babe"" Ruth is Hercules and Thor reincarnated, the Colossus of Swat. His bat is the club of Hercules and the hammer of Thor, the symbol of sheer, primitive might before which the puny folk bow and offer worship. But for the game of baseball, the youngest game of the youngest peo? ple, George Herman Ruth, the ""Babe"" Ruth who dwarfs all other personalities in the daily news, might have been a peaceful cigar maker or perhaps a third-rate heavyweight pugilist instead of the national idol of the American people. The ""Babe"" was Fortune's dar? ling, though Fortune concealed her great and kindly intentions as far as he was concerned when the ""Babe"" was 2. boy. For the ""Babe"" was born left-hander!. Hercules was a right-hander. Thor never was pic? tured as wielding his hammer from the port side. None of the heroes of antiquity, as far as can be ascer? tained, was a southpaw. Harry Leon Wilson was the first novelist to put a left-hander in the near-hero class, and he i ;d it in a half-hearted fashion. Moreover, little George Herman Ruth was a half-orphan at a very early age and was sent to an insti? tution for orphans. He was nearly an orphan boy, and, according to the San ford and Merton books, he should have taken a morbid sort of point of view at an early age and learned something useful. But the youth of ""Babe"" Ruth was applied mostly to the study of the great American game of baseball. You are not going to draw any conventional moral from the early boyhood of ""Babe"" Ruth. He was not a particularly industrious or thrifty lad, chockful of conventional virtues. He was just a normal, chuckle-headed combination of Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn. He Was Just natural and just human. FORTUNATELY the boyhood of ""Babe"" Ruth was intrusted to men who understand human nature, and particularly the human boy?the Christian Brothers, of Bal? timore. The fraternity is not limited to Baltimore. It is all over the *orld. It is made up of big-hearted ?fcn. consecrated to the work of mak lfig men out of the raw material. They had charge of the bringing UP of George Herman Ruth and 'hey have turned over to the world ??Colossus of Swat. It is due to th*ir human understanding that George Herman Ruth was not wwarted and turned aside into more Wo**ic iine8 0f encjeavor, U?Kt lanatiQ than ?sqr *rf fbe I boy romances of Tattered Tom and Ragged Dick, by Horatio Alger jr. ; is the rise of ""Babe"" Ruth. The Al-, | ger heroes became mere bankers or traction magnates, but George Her | man Ruth, the waif of Baltimore, be? came ""Babe"" Ruth, at whose shrine ' bankers and traction magnates burn incense. Ever and anon these jaded near-successes pick up the tape, not to see the condition of the market, but to learn whether the latest is the forty-fifth or forty-sixth home run ! knocked out by the ""Babe"" for the I season. And these heroes envy ""Babe"" ! Ruth the left-handed, the boy who ! was regarded as far from bright in ;his classes. For the ""Babe"" can hit them out with the joyous freedom of Hei-culcs swinging his club or Thor throwing his hammer through the' clouds. All the tricks of the pitchers are vain when he faces them, and all the walls of the baseball parks are lowered when his bat crashes against the baseball. Homer would have loved him if the blind singer had had a season pass to the Polo Grounds. THAT Ruth is the greatest bat? ter of them all is admitted by two members of the old Orioles; and when two members of the old Orioles agree upon anything, that makes it official and irrefutable. If there is anybody so ignorant of im? portant American history that he does not know who the old Orioles are, we will explain, more in pity than in indignation, that the old Orioles were members of the great? est baseball team of a generation or so ago. The two Orioles who made the ad? mission that ""Babe"" Ruth was the greatest baseball player in the whole world are Wilbert Robinson, mana? ger of the Brooklyn National League baseball team, and Joseph Kelly, scout for the Yankees. Both of these gentlemen are grandfathers and citi? zens of high repute in the city where they dwell, which also happens to i be the home of ""Babe"" Ruth. ""Wil-1 bert Robinson was a catcher, and still ; holds the world's record for consecu? tive base hits in one game. Joseph Kelly was an outfielder of sorts on the old Orioles, and his present oc-1 cupation is ""ivory hunting,"" looking upon baseball playera and appraising them ?at their true jrtb to their employers and to the national pas? time. These two authorities admitted"" to me in th? presence of witnesses that never, even in the days of the old Orioles, was there a baseball player who could hit like ""Babe"" Ruth. Con? sider the importance of this admis? sion. The members of the old Ori? oles are the most conservative per? sons in th vorld. Never before have they au. : ..ed that any player of the present was anywhere near as wonderful as tl\e players of their glorious day. ""He can hit them harder than any? body, and he can hit them oftener,"" they admitted from the fullness of their hearts. They did not qualify the statement, They did ?ob assert that the pitchers were less canny and that the ball parks were smaller. They admitted that the heroes of their day were lost in the shadow of the Colossus of Swat. They admitted that even in the days when the old Orioles were young ""Babe"" Ruth would have loomed up above them all. That Ruth broke all big league records for home run getting last year is in the book. That he has broken his own record this year and is on the way to setting a mark far beyond the misty horizons ?if the baseball world is l?o\vn. But the old Orioles have explained away the performances of other more modern heroes of baseball. Ruth's achieve? ments they Jrott ungrudgingly., That is almost as marvelous as the achievements themselves. . ONCE upon a time the youth of this land worshiped another young giant, a right-hander and an exponent of another and el? der sport?John L. Sullivan. The right arm of John L. ?Sullivan was mighty in its day, but the left arm i of ""Babe"" Ruth is mightier in its I day and generation in the matter of sheer numbers of worshipers. | They used to block the corridors of the hotels, and even the streets,1 ? to see the mighty John L. pass. They do that in the case of ""Babe"" Ruth, I too. It is not for me to disparage | the memory of John L. Sullivan, the | gladiator, in th? days-cf hi? greatest -? ring glory, but I think, that his ad? mirers saw that particular John L. through rose glasses and that they worshiped an illusion. The John L. Sullivan of the later ! day, the John L. who beat down his ? own worst enemy and lifted up his ; self-respect from the muck, was the John L. that should have been wor- ; shiped, for that John L. Sullivan : was a mighty gladiator. The John , L. Sullivan who knocked out ring an- j tagonists with a right-hand punch to j the jaw was a mere mass of brawn ? and muscle, but the gray and fat old | John L. who conquered himself was i the true fighter. But we are considering the John L. that was the popular idol, the ' brawny man who was followed by ' the men and the boys and cheered when he stalked abroad. He was ! not a particularly affable character. This big ""Babe"" Ruth is a far more likable person. He is full of i good nature and the joy of living. He is a modest enough young man, : and he knows his limitations, though ; he acknowledges no limitations as j far as the baseball diamonds and j the fences around them are con cerned. He is not falsely modest to the point of affectation, for he has that supreme confidence in himself that comes after certain achievement. But he will not play to the gallery consciously. He likes the gallery and he understands it, and he likes to have it understand him. ? Ruth is, perhaps, too simple, or it may be too wise, to try to fool his gallery, as other stars of his own ; game or stars in other lines of en? deavor have tried to do in vain. For nobody can fool his gallery. No truly wise man ever tried. THE best judges of a man ar? the men with whom he works ! or with whom he plays. ""Babe"" Ruth, naturally, is the high? est salaried ballplayer on the New York Yankees. He might, if he were like some of the stars of baseball or i stars of some of the arts, claim all the privileges of a star and hold himself aloof from his fellow players. Here again is the simplicity or the wisdom of ""Babe"" Ruth. He plays the game with the team and for the team, and the men ' he plays with know it and appreciate it. ""Babe' Ruth will even make the ""college try"" to get a base on an impossible chance. The ""cdllege try"" is the vet? eran professional's term of contempt for zealous endeavor that seems fu? tile on the facts of it. _ an the ""Babe"" *nake?th? two owners of the Yankees, Colonels I Ruppert and Huston, shudder with ! apprehension when he hurls himself against a wall to get a fly ball, or I when he throws his huge bulk through the air in the effort to steal i a base. They rejoice in his spirit and his wholehearted way of play? ing, but at the same time they per? spire with apprehension lest some? thing should happen that would de? prive them of the most expensive in? vestment in professional baseball. Some stars have disrupted base? ball teams, rousing jealousies, but ""Babe"" Ruth, admittedly the great? est star of them all, has made the Yankees a team. The advent of the ""Babe"" has brought them the chance of that ""world's scries dough,"" which should be something like $7,000 a player. It has also made them the team of the big leagues. They do not begrudge the ""Babe"" the homage that is paid him. As far as Ruth is concerned, there is no professional jealousy on the Yankee team. Just to what extent the present prosperity of professional baseball is due to ""Babe"" Ruth I would not care to say, but it is considerable When I first trailed West with tht Yankees, they told me in Chicagc that there had been little or no in tereat in the Chicago White Sox. Bu I when the Yankees came ta Cbicagi they turned out to the extent of 20, 000 a day and upward to see the ""Babe"" ""bust one."" Once, with the score 2 to 1 in the eighth and a tense pitchers' duelen, the Chicago pitcher passed ""Babe"" Ruth. Ten thousand people started to walk out of Comiskey Park. There remained yet the chance of the melodramatic ninth inning rally, but the ten thousand had lost all interest in the game for the after? noon.

Harold Muddy Ruel, the energetic pepper box who does Washing ton's backstopping day in and day out in a manner which has won him praise all over the American League circuit, is practically a unanimous choice of this section of the United States of America for honorable mention on Babe Ruths all-American baseball com bination which will be instrumental in sending two readers of this newspaper to the world series month after next. In pawing through his enormous correspondence containing selec tions to be matched against Babes from readers of The Washing ton Times sporting pages, “Skillet” Finn, Esq., is strongly reminded of the esteem in which Ruel is held and it may be gratifying to the thousands of contestants for the two free world trips to know that their fellows are boosting Ruel for Ruths consideration. In “Skillet” Finn, Esq.s humble opinion, there is no better con clusion to draw from a thorough study of the big league catchers than that Muddy is a perfect all-around catcher. Whether his royal majesty, Babe Ruth is of the same belief remains to be seen. Its a Chinese cinch that the Bambino will have to look far and wide for a better candidate than our own little backstop, who has the admira tion of thousands of American League followers. Maynard J. Hogan. 722 Eigh-- teenth street, in inditing an all- American outfit to be compared with Babe Ruths, and in hopes that his choice will earn him a jaunt to the series with ""Skillet"" Finn, Esq., as guide and chaperon, says that Muddy Ruel is the “greatest catcher in the business.” Thats a pretty broad statement, but not overdrawn in the least, for it is a treat to see a catcher lik® Ruel back there working his head off every minute of the game- Warren Smith Hammond, 2523 Thirteenth street, is a bit mild in his praise of Ruel, but names him with Ring and Pennock as his battery. He says, “Ruel is a VERY GOOD catcher and is no mean hand with the willow.” But Warren is only a little boy thirteen years old and his expression is certainly forceful for his years. Then comes the stamp of ap- Rroval slapped on Ruel by J. F. Iclnteer, of Quantico, Va. who earned one of the free trips to New York last year. With but a slight difference in person nel, Mclnteers choice of a year ago was almost identical to* Ruths, and his opinion about the players this season ought to amount to something. ""Ruel is the best and steadiest catcher Ive seen this year.” writes Mclnteer and “Skillet” will say, that Mclnteer has seen plenty be cause the Quantico telegrapher has been sneaking up to Washington all summer long taking stock of the Griffmen as well as the invad ing teams.

The greatest baseball player in the j world, George Sisler, arrived in Bo-j galusa Tuesday and on Wednesday j was at practice, enthusiastic over the grounds an dconvenienccs arranged j here for the Browns. With such ideal training conditions, Mr. Sisler be lieves that his record of last year will not compare with the one he intends to make this season. Readers of The Enterprise wil] be interest in the fol lowing story of Sisler and his won derful playing. George Sisler was the most bril liant player of 1920. His dazzling ■exploits dominate the records as those of Ty Cobb used to. In batting he was easily first with the phenomenal average of .407. In run scoring he tied for first place with Tris Speaker at 137 tallies. In stolen bases he was j second only to Sam Rice, the flyiftgj mercury of the Washington Senators. I In number of runs driven in, he tied j at second place with his teammate j -Jacobson at 122 tallies, acknowledg-j mg no superior but Babe Ruth. Nor j was his wonderful batting record in -any sense a fluke, for Sisler took part in the full schedule of 154 games and appeared at bat more than any other player, 631 times. In the number of his hits, he not only exceeded all com petitors, but broke the previous American League record with a grand total of 257 safe hits. What is more, he led all competitors in number of total bases, even Babe Ruth with his 54 home runs being forced to take a back seat. Just one short of an «yen 400, Sisler piled up a grand to tal of 399 bases, a record unmatched in modern baseball. In two-base hits he was second only to Speaker. In ""three-base hits he was second only to Joe Jackson. In home runs he was second only to Babe Ruth. Such a record is an all-round masterpiece whose like may not be seen again for many years. From his youth up a veritable gale of good fortune has blown George Sisler on his way. While he was still a school boy in an obscure Ohio town, prominent baseball men had their eye on him. While he was a college un der-graduate big league clubs were eager to sign him. His entry into major league baseball nearly precip itated a war of the magnates and was remotely responsible for the overthrow of the National Commis sion. His career with the St. Louis Browns has been a continuous tri umph, always on the upward scale, culminating in the grand climax of the season just closed. Favored by «verj possible talent, fleet of foot as an arrow, a wonderful fielder, a phe nomenal hitter, and when so minded, a brilliant pitcher, Sisler is one of the greatest all-round players, if not tlje very greatest, that baseball has ever produced. This is high, praise and yet the faces deserve it. In purely offensive departments of play, Sisler has not yet equalled Ty Cobb, though during the past season he fell little short of the Georgian at his best. In defense, however, Sisler is a better natural fielder than Cobb. He is furthermore Transfer? A fa t chance!",BLNK

WHEN the marvels of the cathode or X ray were made known to the world only a few years ago, it was believed we had reached a degree of photographic power that would not be sur passed for generations to come, and that for the use of surgeons in locating foreign substances imbedded in flesh or bone it would be of permanent value. Yet according to reports of experiments made by Pro fessor Barker in Philadelphia a short time ago, that wonderful ray is about to become a back number be cause of the potency shown by a newly discovered element known as ""radium."" The discovery of the new element is due to M. and lime. Curie and is the result of investigations stimu lated by the discovery of the X-ray. They were ex perimenting in 1898 with uranium and its salts, which exert a feeble photographic power, when they ob served phenomena indicating the existence of an un known factor in the mass. They at once directed their investigations to the separation of that element from the substances with which it was associated and found not one but two new elements. To the first they gave the name ""polonium"" and to the second '•radium."" The first is believed to have a radiant power five hundredfold greater than that of uranium, but Professor Barker estimates the efficiency of ra dium at one hundred thousand times that of uranium. For this reason and because of its comparative cheap ness and simplicity the second of the Curies' discov eries seems destined, it is said, to replace the costly and complicated X-ray apparatus in the realm of sur gery. The most extraordinary characteristic of the new element is thus described in an account of Professor Barker's experiments by the New York Tribune: ""The practicability of deriving one form of energy heat, light, electricity or chemical action— from some other has long been recognized, but it is axiom atic that none of them can be produced except by that method. It is believed that the most man can do is to transform. It is thought that he cannot, in any true sense, create. Roentgen obtained his X-rays only by a conversion of force previously existing in the form of electricity. But a radiance which will penetrate opaque bodies and act upon the chemicals on a photographic plate is secured from radium with out the apparent use of any known species of energy. The phenomenon may yet be explained. But at pres ent it looks very much like what has long been re garded an impossibility, the spontaneous generation of force."" The discovery of unknown elements of such mar velous potencies at this late stage in the investigations of science is a striking proof of how little we know of the substances that lie around us or of the forces that act upon them. There is no telling wlrit wide and high uses may yet be made of radium, but it is probable the discovery will be one of the most im portant gifts which this century v:ill bestow for the guidance of science in that which is to come","December 1898 : Marie Curie, along with her husband, discover new elements “polonium” and “radium”"

At was a beautiful tribute to the modesty of womankind that Mine. Curie made when she discovered the element which has revo- lutionized physics, chemistry and some branches of medicine, and gave it an impersonal name. The courtesy of the labora- -tory dictates that the discoverer of a new thing under the sun may give it his own name if he wishes, and so perpetuate nia own glory. Mme. Curie called it radium, because it gives out HINTS TO GARDENERS More than sentiment attaches to the gift. Of course, it money value, something like $100,000, will have little weight with a devotee of science like Mme. Curie.: She will use the radium for scientific research. Although Mme. Curie knows more concerning radium and its potentialities than any living soul, she has not, because of her generosity, one grain with which to conduct experiments. The history of the discovery of radium is one of the most exalted romances that the world has ever known. The daugh- ter of a professor in the University of Warsaw, the present Mme. Curie was drawn to Paris by the magnetic pull of the renowned scientific schools there. In conjunction with the scientists Becquerel and Curie, she began a series of experiments with uranium which led to her discovery of radium. It also led to her happy marriage with Professor Curie. That the discovery was that of Mme. Curie alone was well established by a com- mission which awarded her the Nobel prize in 1903. The hope which radium holds out to the world is that it may be the means of fighting cancer, that malignant disease which has baffled physicians for centuries. Undoubtedly there are new fields into which researchers can go. And it is in these unexplored regions that Mme. Curie will venture. The women of America honor themselves by providing the means.","May, 1921 : Curie is presented with 1 gram of radium by US President Warren Harding at the White House."

Of late yeais men of science and oth ers hive wrangled much over Mr. Dar win's work on The Origin of Species."" In most of the English and American reviews his treatise lms been Muverely criticised, as having an infidel tendency; not on account of (lie facts therein giv en, but the conclusion of ihe author. He appears to liavo been very generally rnLsunilerstood, judging from a most in teresting little woik just insued by D. Appleton Jc Co., this city, beim: the publictiou of six lectures delivered to woikiugmen, by Thomas II. Huxley, F. R. S., Professor of Natural History in the School of Mines, London. Broadly slated, the subject of these lectures consists of an inquiry into the oiii'in of species and a discussion on the causes of the phenomena in organic naiure. The meaning of organic uature is something that grows, lias life and le productive powers. It is exemplified in tliu seed of a plan: in contradistinc tion to n grain of sand. Organic nature embraces the vegetable and animal kingdom, as entirely distinct in tunc tions from loeke, fluids, and what chem ists call ""elementary matter."" Ani mals and plants are divided by natural ists into gioups,and these into kitijidoms, sub-kingdoms,jirovinces, cl.tsses.orders, families, genera and species- it was once very generally believed (and many person entertain such views still) that there vras'such a thing s spontaneous generation that is, mere eiemeiitiiry malter, such as pure water or mineral dust exposed in favorab'e positions, to light aud heat, would bring forth vege tation and nnimalcula spontaneously Hence it has been asserted that, if there is such phncomena as the spon.atieous generation of life, according to the ""de velopment theory"" of torao uiituralists and the -views of Mr. Darwin on the origin of species, man may have been developed from the lowest forms of spontaneous generation. If Mich views were founded on facts in na'ural history, pantheism, viz that ""God is nature and naiure is God,"" would bo suppos ed upon a very firm foundation. Mr. Darwin doos not discuss the question of tpontaneous gonerati -n at all, and science completely silences pantheism. Every organism commen ces existence in an gg-eell or seed, and each seed is believed to lie been specially created, with special functions and powers of reproduction, as stated in th Scriptures. Al. Pasteur, a dis tinguished French chemists, has lately made a great number of carefully con ducted experiments to lest the theory of hpomaneous generation. The result of hi labors rfcem to be conclusive againt the theoij; no such propert) as spontaneous crfc&'iou belongs to ele mentary matter acted upon by thw forces of nature. An old and bitterly dispu ted question thus appear now to be settled scientifically. Another miestion of much dispute seems lo bs settled bv Mr. Darwin; tints the Caucasian, the Malay, and the Ae gto, according to his facts, are varieties ol xpecieis and way alMiave descended fiom a single pair, as set forth in the Scriptures. On the other Hand, t'ror. Agassiz and others believe that they have descended from difieicnt original pairs, jind thus j.ley would really bo liffeient orders.

To conform to these changes there must be a consequent continual varia? tion in the constitution and characteristics of plants and animals. The members of each species are,- therefore, constantly vary? ing-those dwelling in oue locality ever de? veloping new and needed capacities, and those in* a different situation acquiring di? verse enes, according to their necessity until finally, in the course of many genera? tions, the change has become .so great that distinct species ure recognized, or, in other words, the protjess of the evolution of- one species from another has been effected.

Darwinism la a form ol what iu modern scientltlc add theological parlance la called tvolutiQuism. The following quolallon trom a living author probably would be accepted by Ibo parties ranged on either side ol these questlqps, as substantially a correct statement of the doctrine in its j widestI'otm: ""Tlioddctrine of Evolution -known also as the Law Scheme, and the Development Hypothesis, in its ripest torm, is that all things wo perceive, including what are called spiritual phenomena, have come Itom the simplest beginnings, solely by means ol Buch forces and laws as belong lo matter, buppose all matter expanded into one great cloud ol atoms. Then these atoms, by virtue of properties inherent in lltemwlm, would, in course of time,come together into worlds, into astronomic systems, into the vegetable and animal kingdoms, and even into that great spiritual realm which ia the chief wonder and glory of Nature."" Tho above is a statement of the doctrine of evolutionism In general. But as applied to the different Isolds it has taken Uireo principal lorms. The general theory M a stem which separates into these aa its branohes. The first is the AVrtiJar Hflolhuit. It deals with the mftWlnt* nf wnrlrio Afwiwffnar tr? Ironditfon ol the universe at the moat remote time in the past to which science c&u penetrate was thai of matter in a highly attenuated and widely diffused state. It is often spoken of a* star-dust or firemlst. This matter had in it all tho forces and properties which now belong to it, and, under their operation elono and in accordance with them, the sun and moon and stars wcro evolved, and took their places in (be order of the heavens. The sejond lorrn of evolutionism it Sponiaiuoue Generation. It deals with the origin tit llle. According to it, llto, instead of being something which is Introduced ab alra even at its tint appearance in the world, is the result ol the peculiar arrangement ol the atoms ol water. Huxley, lor example, teaches that ""the matter of lite is composed of ordinary matter, differing Irom it only in the mumer.ia which its atoms are aggregated. The third lorm which evolutionism assumes is Darmniim, as it is properly called, or the traiumutaUon of ycut. It deals with plants and animals. It undertakes to show that all plants and animals, Including man, came, by the operation alone ot oertain natural laws, from ono or a lew species, which were introduce by creation, or by spontaneous generation into the world at? period ?o remote that we cannot with any distincthob ho back to it.j For the Kks ol clearness it has asemed proper thnsto Mate the general doctrine ol evolutionism and the branches Into which it divides. Still It ii not true that became a man accepts one of its forms be most alto recctve the other. In fact inch Isnottfeeoise. For instance Dsrwin diflers with Huxley aa to the origin of life. Darwin believes that the Almighty breathed life in the beginning in bis supposed progenitor or progenitors ol the whole animal and Testable kingdoms. Bat Huxley traces life to the forces which ho supposes to belong eiMntially to the original particles of matter. TDK NAHK Or DABWIIUSU. The writer Intends in wj)at he may present in these articles, to confine himself to Darwinism proper. It is populate known by this name because oT the prominence of Professor Charlca Darwin of England in connection with it. He first expounded his theory In an essay published In 1859 on the ""Origin of species by Means of Natural Selection."" nis work was soon translated Into all the leading European languages. It made a profound popular ltnpresaiqn, and has been sold by thousands ol copies. In It ho confined the application of his theory to animals and plants, and passed by man. About two and a half years ago, however, ho published another work called .""The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex,"" in which he in the most unequivocal manner applies his doctrine to the human race, la the same line are his ""Animals and Plants under Domestication,"" and i ""The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals."" While the prominence of Darwin In connection with tUs tbeory has been such that it is called after him, he is not alone in its adoption. The num- j bcr ol persons who can fairly claim h j place in the ranks of scientific men and i who have received it is much .smaller both in Europe and America than many of the lees learned would suppose. Still there are enough of them to command serious attention. A. K. Wallace prdponnded the hypothesis about the same time with Darwin, and stillisanadvocatsi ol It though with some limitations. Herbert Spenct'r In hia ""Principles of Biology"" eargerly endorse* it and uses It for the purposes of his system ot philosophy. Others whose names are lesa familiar to th? general public could alio be mentioned a3 its adherents. the two great u? of darwinism. Tho general hypothesis ol Darwinism la that all plants and animals, including man, came from one or a few species by tho operation of certain natural laws. Of these laws, it is held that there are two. The first Is called Natural Selection Tho word Kchction Id this phase is calculated to convey to the mind of the uninitiated the idea that the plant or animal concerned exercises some choice In the matter. But the word natural is used to qualify it, for the purpose ot guarding against such a construction. The whole phase indicates a process from, which everything amounting to an intelligent choice of the end attained is excluded. This law may bo better understood by its other name of the Survival of the Filtat When plants and animals greatly multiply, as they ever tend to do, there is a struggle lor existence. In that struggle the strongest, that Is those which are best adapted to the circumstances, survive and the weaker perish. And aa a consequence those species which are the strongest are perpetuated, and the peculiarities in which their strength lies are developed until they become new species. By this process of a few primordial germs the plants and animals of our era ot the world have been in the Ispse of ages produced. The other of the laws is oalled Sexual Selection. It is supposed to come into exercise along with natural selection in the origin of animals and of man."" 80 prominent is it held to bo in this sphere that tha ..-I 41 r tuu vvuoiuciaviuu Ul ll MUUUpiCB lUtCC* fourths of the work of Darwin on the J ""Descent ol Man."" It is there treated as a corner stone with which the whole edi- J fice stands or falls. To it we as men are t! supposed to owe our power of song and 8 our hairlessneaa ot body and much that distinguishes us from the beasts. To it also he attributes the rise and conserve- lion of the various races of the human t species. Under.the head ol sexual selection, Dar- r win includes two distinct processes. One1 ol these applies to the male, and the e other to the female. The mate, who is j endowed with superior strength and activity, drives away rivals and thereby succeeds in perpetuating and still further 1 developing tho peculiarities by which he ii is distinguished. This, however, is sub- c stattially the same thing in its operation t as natural selection and may be so treat- ed in the discussion. The process as to j the female is a practical preference for u certain males on account of some such quality as beauty of form, or color, or a odor, or voice. In mating she chooses c them because ol these things, and thereby a perpetuates and still further develnpis them, until as a result new species arise TUB OIliaiN OP MAN. t By the operation ol these principles all J plants and animals are supposed to have been derived from ono or more primor- 1 dial germs. Any complete discussion ol Darwinism therefore must range over the r whole field of organic existences. But by the application of the hypothesis to I man the subject is brought directly home to ourselves as a raco. The following ia 8 the conclusion to which Darwin comes. 1 It is stated in his own language: ""We thus learu that man is descended from a hairy quadruped, furnished with a tail, and pointed cars, probably arboreal in its habits, and an inhabitant of the Old World. This creature, if its whole struc- 8 turo bad been examined by a naturalist, would have been classed among the quod- rumana, a* surely as would the common and still more ancient marsulllal anima', and this through a long line of diversified lorms, either from some reptile-like or some amphibian-like creature, and this again Irom some fish-like animal Id the 8 dim obscurity or the past we can see that tho early progenitor ol all the vertebrata j must have been an aquatic animal provld- ed with branchia, with the twoiexeannit- S cd in tho same individual, and with the J mostilmportantjorgansof the body (such t as the brain and heart) imperfectly devel- oped. This animal seems to have been J more like the larvae of our existing ma- fine ascidtana than any other known form. By the same general process our Si12?.lual P?wera fid general moral disposition have been undeveloped aocording to this theory. ,THK QUESTION AT ISSUE. Soch ist fair statement of Darwinism J and its fundamental principles. In de- S elding for or against its truth, the query I Is not whether any tuch principles at nat- J ural selection and sexual selection obtain o in nature. This is not denied by any competent ludge.

About 50 years ago Charles Dar- Iwln, the world's greatest naturalist and Herbert Spencer, the world's greatest philosopher, announced their belief In the theory of evolu jtlon as an explanation of the order of the universe. It startled chrls tlans and was opposed with a logic learning, eloquence and wit per haps unequaled by any discussions of the past. It was an age when the rack, the gibbet, the cross and any other form of physical punish ment for opinion's sake had passed away, and the appeal was made to reason. After fifty years of the most careful scrutiny, the severest crit icisms, the most eloquent and learn ed discussions, by the best scholars on both sides, it has won Its way intc literature, college text books, lec tures, -sermons and the thought of the masses, so that but few who lay Just claim to scholarship deny the truth of its claims and the effort now is to harmonize the facts of na ture and the experiences of life with j its teachings. The evolutionists 1 themselves are not agreed as to their i theories. It is true of them as diaries Darwin taught of the strug i gles of the various forms of life on j the earth for existence, ""The strug i gle is greatest among the individ uals of the same kind; because they subsisting on the same food and liv ing under the same conditions, come ilnto more direct contact and there fore direct conflict, with each other for the same things."" This is true of the various denominations of the I Christian church. It has been ob served in a majority of cases where there is in any city or country a sharp competition or rivalry between denominations of Christians, that I those most alike were the greatest rivals. So it has been with the ad Jvocates of evolution. They have dl jvided into three schools of thought iviz: Atheistic, who eliminated God from the idea of the universe, Deis tic, who believe in God, believe that He created all things and that evo lution was His mode of operation but believe that after calling the primary substances Into being, and placing them under certain laws, He left them to work out their destiny without interference of guidance; Thelstlc, who believe in God, be lieve that all material things are expressions of His life, energy and thought, that He is In them and clothes Himself with them and that their movements under what we call natural law are His modes of oper ation. It is this theory of evolu tion that we will in a series of ar ticles discuss. We do not care to discuss the Atheistic nor the Dels tic, but to set forth the arguments that are generally relied on for he support of evolution in general and then for Theistic evolution. I The arguments used for the sup port of evolution are from the var ious branches of science. They come from the generally accepted facts classified under the general heads of biology, geology, embryology, eoology, astronomy, physiology, an thropology, bibliology, history and sociology. The principal laws In operation jare (1) all life struggles for expres sion. (2) There is In all forms of I life a struggle for existence. (3) In the struggle for existence there will be the survival of the fittest; in other words, the survival of the best 'adapted to Its environments. In the survival of the fitest, the sur vlval of the unfit Is Impossible. This occurs because there is not room or food for all that comes Into being and only that which ls best adapted Ito the conditions of life can live (5) The above facts are responsible for what we call nature's law of selection and rejection. (6) In all the individuals of any species there is a tendency to variation. This var iation is often in size as in case where one Is better fed than anoth er. It may be in color, as is some times seen the nature of the food Is changed. It Is seen ln the thick ness of the skin or the color of the hair as a result of climate. There are also changes of texture .chemi cal changes in blood, sap and juices of the body on account of soil, water and the mental states of animals These and other facts, It is argued make evolution possible. Tbe ques tion then arises, is it probable? In the answer to this question may be found the evidences from nature as seen ln the various fields of invest! gat ion. in the phenomena of the un Iverse.",1900: Darwin’s theory of evolution gains national acceptance and his intellectual pursuits are credited for “progressing the country.” His theories are even used in advertisements to promote furniture sales.

February 12th, 1809, where he received the el?n e its of his education at the local grammar school. Mr. Darwin went iu 1S35 to the University of Edinburgh, whence, afler two years of study, he went to Christ's College. Cambridge. At the latter place he took his degree In 1831, and the same year volunteered as naturalist aboard the Bea-le In its exploring expedition nr<>und the world. The publication in 1839 of an account of his discoveries in natural history and geology while on this voyage was the beginning of a career ol authorship extending through forty-three years. A large number of books and papers ""from his pen on scientific subjects had appeared when. in 1859. his fainons work on '-Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection"" was published. In it Mr. Darwin attempted to account for the diverse forms of life on the globe on a theory of continuous development from simpler structures,without the intervention of special creative flats at the origin of each species. Large deductions were drawn by others frmn the principles laid down, and ""Dfir.vini.sm"" became the subject or hot debate. A catalogue of the literature of Darwinism contains 86 octave pasres of the titles of books and 312 names of authors. In 1871 appeared ''The Descent of Man, and Selection In Kelation to Sex*"" a work complementary to that on the origin of species. In 1 this work it was sought to prove that man is descended from a lower order of animal?""from a hairy quadru|>ed. furnished with a tail and Krinted ears, probably arboreal in its habits."" r. Darwin is not, however, authority for the doctrine that man is descended from the monkey. so often credited to him. Nor can he be considered the father of the doctrine of evolution, though he was one of Its principal supporters. Iu this, as in other fields, the Greeks had anticipated modern thought. The first to torin a distinct hypothesis of evolution in modern times was Lamarck, a Frenchman, who In 1809 published his views, and Mr. Herbert Spencer was the first to systematize it into a philosophy of general application. Mr. Darwin was famous for his habit of patient and careful investigation, and with little turn for speculation, confined himself to his studies iu natural history and zoology. WHAT DARWINISM IS. Reducing the conception to the greatest possible precision, Herbert Spencer defines evolu tion as a change froin the homogeneous to the heterogenec us, from the general to the special^ from the indefinite and simple to the definite and complex. On this hypothesis, the universe as it now exist is the result of an almost infinite series of chances, ""relat ed to and dej enient upon each other, as successive steps, or rather irrowths. constituting a progress analogous to the unfolding or evolving of the parts of a growing organism."" This process of development is considered to be ""traceable in the formation ut'tiie worlds in space, in the multiplication of the types and species of plant3 and animals on the globe, in the origination and diverity of languages, literature, arts and sciences, and in all the changes of human institutions and society."" In biology, as at present employed, evolution is a general name tor ""the history of the steps by which any living being has acquired the morphological and the physiological characters which distinguish it. No exception is* at this time, known to the general law. established upon an immense multitude of direct'observations, that every living thing is evolved frotn a particle of matter in which no trace of the distinctive characters of the adult form of that living thing is dlseernable."" The doctriue of evolution, however, is not identical with Darwinism, a term which came iuto current use with the publication of Mr. Darwin's ""The Origin of Species"" and ""The Descent of Man Darwinism Is one of the attempts to explain the law or manner of evolution, finding the cause of the differentiation of species to lie in the struggle of the organism to adapt itself to the constantly altering conditions of its environment. These conditions of external life act on plants and animals in their natural state with an effect analogous to that by which artificial cultivation or breeding by man can change and improve the characteristics of the different domestic plants and animals. This process of the operation of natural circumstances, by which those varieties or individuals best adapted to their surroundings of climate, station, character of soil, food-supply and the number and kind of living being competing in the ""struggle for existence."" are preserved ihe longest in life, was called by Mr. Darwin ""natural selection."" But he not only saw that the constant battle for life going on among living creatures must be a ""winnowing and improving process, those least adapted to the situation giving way before those better adapted; it was his merit to discover that natural selection is capable of projntciiig fitness between organisms and their circumstanccs. and of discerning the importance of the consequences that follow."" Fromthe almost general admission of naturalists that natural selection was potent in the production of varieties in species, Mr. Darwin went further, aud held that one species sprang from anoth?r ""bv al one continued process of slow variation and natural selection."" DARWIN'S THEORY OF EVOLUTION. The article on ""Evolution"" in the Encyclopaedia Brltannica, written by Professor Huxley and James Sully, has the following regarding Mr. Darwin: The honor of working out this theory of evolution on a substantial basis of fact belontrs to England. Of the writers who have achieved this result Mr. Darwin deserves the first notice. Though modestly confining himself to the problem of accounting for the evolution of the higher organic forms out of the lower. Mr. Darwin has done much to further the idea of a gradual evolution of the physical world. The philosophical significance of* the hypothesis of natural selection, especially associated with Mr. Darwin, is due. as Professor Uehnholtz points out, to the fact that it Introduces a strictly mechanical conception in order to accouut for those intricate arrangements known as organic adaptations which had before been conceived only in ateleological manner..By viewing adaptations as conditions of self-preservation Mr. Darwin is able to explain how it is that the seemingly purposeful abounds in organic nature. In so doing he has done much to eliminate the teleological method from biology. It is true that in his conception of seemiugly spontaneous variations and of correlations of growth he leaves room for the old manner of viewing organic developments as controlled by some internal organizing principle. Yet his theory, as a whole, is clearly a heavy blow to the teleological method. Again. Mr. Darwin has trreatlv extended th? scope of mechanical Interpretation by making intelligible, apart firora the co-operation of intelligent purpose, the genesis of the organic world as a harmonious system ot distinct groups, a unity in variety, having certain wellmarked typical affinities. How greatly this arrangement lias helped to support the idea ot an ideal plan, we have had occasion to observe. Mr. Darwin, in his doctrine of the organic world as a survival, refers this appearance of systematic plan to perfectly natural causes, and in so doing he gives new meaning to the ancient theory that the harmony of the world arises out of discord. Once more,"" Mr. Darwin's hypothesis is of wide philosophic interest, since it'helps to support the idea of a perfect gradation in the progress of things. The variations which he postulates are alight, If not infinitesimal. and only effect a sensible functional dr morphological change after they have been frequently repeated and accumulated by heredity. Mr. Darwin's later work, in which he applies his theory of the origin ot species to man, is a valuable contribution to a naturalistic conception of human development. The mind of man in Its lowest stages of development is here brought into close Juxtaposition to the animal mind, and the upward progress of man is viewed as effected by natural causes, chief among which Is the action of natural selection. Mr. Darwin does not inquire into the exact way in which the mental and the bodily are connected. He simply assumes tiiat, just as the bodily organism is capable of varying in an indefinite number of wavs. so may the mental faculties vary indei finitely in correspondence with certain physical changes. la this way he seeks to account for all the higher mental powers, as the use of language and reason, the sentiment of beauty j and conscience. Finally, Mr. Darwin seeks to give a practical and ethical turn to his doctrine. He appears to make the end of evolution the conscious end of man's action, since he defines the general good as ""the rearing of the greatest number of Individuals in lull health and vigor, and with all their faculties perfect, under the conditions to which they are subject."" Further, In his view of the future of the race, Mr. Darwin leans to the idea that the natural process which has effected man's first progress must continue to be an Important factor in evolution, and that consequently, it is not well to check the scope of this process by undue restraints of population and a charitable preservation of the incompetent.",1882: Darwin dies.

New Creation Theories. \u25a0 Darwinism met with religious op position almost as bitter as that which assailed Copernicus -when he first de iclared that the world was not flat, but round. In recent years, however, we have come to realize that the Biblical story of the creation should not be j literally interpreted any more than f certain other parts of the Bible and that the idea of creation covering •millions of years and accomplished I jtritbout violating the laws by which nature is now governed is not*one whit less marvelous or divine than a crea tlon in six literal days. Darwin did not claim that the breed log or evolving of new species in na j ture was conducted in a haphazard fashion, but that it was governed by a law, workir.gr toward the constant bet i terment of the Fpeojps. This law he called natural selection, or as Herbert Spencer termed it. ""the survival of the fittest."" and it may be briefly explained las follows: All nature Is at war. Ti*e animal kingdom preys on the vegetable kingdom, and the vegetable kingdom in turn, chiefly in the form of bacteria, preys on the animal kingdom. Aside from this there is extensive civil war within the animal kingdom. Mammals. birds, reptiles, fish and insects all are constantly battling with one another. In the vegetable kingdom also there is a .civil war. the stronger and hardier plants overpowering the weaker ones and choking them. We little realise how fearful is thi« struggle about us. It has been estimated that, taking en average of all forms of life, 999 in j dlvlduGls out of every 1000 die an un natural or violent death. Were this not so the earth would not be large enough to contain all the life that *rould b* produced at the end of a few years. A single pair of almost any animal If exactly adapted to its sur rounding* and not Interfered with in any way, would in a comparatively few jreneratlons overrun the earth. Ele phants are the slowest breeders we know, yet it has been estimated that if every offspring- were permitted to reach maturity the living descendants of a single pair would, at the end of 750 years, number 19,000,000 individuals. Universal -warfare is thus absolutely necessary to keep the living world •within bounds. Now the theory of nat ural selection holds that only those Individuals best fitted for the battle of life stand a chance of surviving. Generation after generation this war hn* wasred. ar.d nature has been killing off all those that vrere unfitted to hold th«ir own. co that eventually races have been evolved which are admirably •idapted to their surro-Jndlnge. Some animals have earned their right to a plsr? in t>.e life of this world by developing sreat strength. Others owe their existence to the de velopment of high speed in getting away from their en*iai*.s. An example of the latter class is the horse, which now has but one toe to each foot, whereas fossil remclns Indicate* that the present horse has gradually evolved from a horse having five toes. This evolution is due to the \u2666hoe* animals which rose on their toes succeeded best in running away from their enemies. The middle. to«t was thus brought most, into action, and nat 'tiral selection encouraged its develop ment at the expense of the otner toes, which were gradually lost. A large part of the animal world owes it« survival to the fact that it bears co close a resemblance to its surroundings that it cannot be readily discovered by its enemies. One of the most Interesting examples of this is Surnlshed by the kalllma butterfly, •whidi 1« found In India. This butterfly is very brilliantly marked, with bands cf bright oranre and blue, but the un ider side of Its wings are the exact \u25a0 shape of a leaf, with Vela markings, in perfect Imitation of the Itaf, *o that jwiien It alights oa c branch and folds ltc wines it can hardly bo distin- Isrulebed. from the Icnv*«. To heighten Ithe illusion the lower ends ef the '•wins* are -prolonged ""lnto a tip, which By A. Rus£eH Bond; norms a stem Sflr the leaf, while one edge of the wings is indented In a manner resembling a damaged Jeaf. Strangely enough, the wings of those butterfliea, which are bred in the fall, have a reddish hue corresponding to the color of fall leaves. It is said that Portuguese explorers of early days brqught home the story of a peculiar tree which in a windstorm sheds Its leaves, but that after, the storm the leaves flew back to their places on the tree. These animated leaves were doubtless the kallima butterfly. An other odd Insect, ls the ""walking stick,"" which bo resembles twig that it eas ily, escapes notice. The oranee-tlnped butterfly Is usually found among .the Rowers of the mustard plant, of which in the matter of color it Is an exact, copy. The ""hickory horned devil"" is an example of another kind of protec tion. This catorplllar Is very large, sometimes half a foot or more in length, and its liorns give it really a most ugly appearance, whereas It is really a very harmless individual. Xow, according to Darwin's theory of evolution, tl>es<»- characteristics have been gradually developed by natural selection in gereration after genera tion. That Is, those butterflies which most closely resemble loaves and those caterpillars which develop the most terrifying aspect stood the best show of survivinr. while the poorer Imita tions were discovered by tneir enemies and devoured. The same selection tonic place in the next generation rind the next, and so on, until. tve now have, an almost perfect imitation. Thlsl. how ever, docs not mean that the butter- fly's battle is now over, for, according to the theory, its enemies in their search for food have become more and more keen and better able to detect the differences between the butterfly and the leaf. This theory of natural selection ls very good as far as it goes, ""but re-, cently new ideas have sprung up. Dar- j win's theory required thousands of generations to form a new snecles, whereas new breeds are artificially de veloped in f very few years.. The orl-. gin of the American trotting horse, for ""ianil». dat»s back to the year-H25. Breeders and fnnciers do not follow the methods which Darwin a««ert«?d are employed by nature.

Thrre Is another thing which is rather dlfficult.to explain by Darwin's theory. Consider, the family tree of^a butterfly. According:, to.

DT MABOATIET F. BUOHANAK. Bo mnoh is constantly being written obout Darwinism, that a plain statement of it, divest ed,so for as is possible, of all scioutiflo tonus, may not bo unprofitable. As America was not called for Us discoverer, Darwinism is not original witli Mr. Darwin. Tho theory of evolution is venerable as natural sci ence. Tho external resemblances of all animals was.oa certain to suggest evolution to Anstotlo as to Kant; and that it was quite generally be lieved by tho scholarly minority In purely Pagan days, it Is reasonable to suppose, since ignor ance of science and tho absence of defined relations between God and Nature must havo strengthened Materialistic theories to a dogroo boyond our comprehension. Tho ideas that provailod wore, however, as Sir Charles Lyoll shows, vary vague. Evolution was suddenly revived la tho Nebu lar Hypothesis of La Place, aud by tho Specula tions of Kant in tho latter half of tho eighteenth century. In tho beginning of tho nineteenth, La marck, Professor of Zoology at tho Qardoa of Plants in Paris, surprised the scientific world with a volume of testimony in its support, and tbQ_book would have been hailed with delight in the grove of Acadomus, for Lamarck demon strated by evolution that life is a moro physical phenomenon, that tho nervous system produces Ideas, and that there is no distinct vital principle. As Lamarck wont back with hla black thread into the labyrinths whore tho Christian idea Is wholly absent, so tho latest German disciples of Dar win have gono back toLnmorok. The Garden of Plants in Paris was tho appropriate field for tho constant debate of tho theory. In Its favor woro Lamarck, Geoffrey St. Hilaire, and tho young Hocks who followed them. To thoir old arose a school in Germany, conspicuous among whoso advocates woro Okon and tho poet Gootho, whoso discovery of tho intermaxillary bone in man, aud his volume on evolution of plants, although not original iu conception, gavo him ns high rank in science as Faust” did in literature. Okon furnished the germ of Hux- ley's protoplasm, aud ho is entitled to tho dis tinction of calling it by oven a harder name— primordial mucosity.” But Cuvibr appeared to reduce evolution to an absurdity in 1830, despite tho number nud the rank of his opponents; nud little was said of it, except iu tho satires., until Alfred Wallace, tho author of puro Darwinism, sent to Loudou, in 1808, tho results of seven years' observation in the Malay Archipelago. Iu this paper ho onuucratod tho hypothesis of Natural Selection, with which evolution, as ad vocated by Darwin, must stand or fall. Dar? wluism is essentially Natural Selection; and this latest rovlval of evolution would, therefore, bo moro appropriately called Wallacblsm. The honor of tho narao has, somewhat naturally, bcou transferred to Darwin, because his first publication on evolution was medo simultane ously with Wallace’s; and because, having le gitimately adopted tho hypothesis of Wallace, ho hccamo, nt once, its most eloquent, most per sistent, and most successful advocate. Evolution assumes that all forms of lifo havo boon produced by previous forms, through tho constant operation of natural laws. Tho special evolution known as Darwinism assumes that this constant production and constant modifica tion of forms has boon, and, therefore, is being, accomplished by natural selection. In a revised edition of his “Origin of Species”(lßC9), Mr. Darwin is led to admit that natural selection may not havo boon tho exclusive means of modification, but that it was tho most important ono. What, then, is Darwinism, or Natural Selec tion? This: As all animals and plants tend to in crease iu geometrical ratio, moro are produced than can live; a struggle for existence con stantly ensues; tho weakest perish, the fittest sur vive. Those survivors, said thus to bo naturally selected, transmit, by tho strong principle of in heritance, their most striking modifications to their offspring. Tho offspring are never precise ly like tho parents. Their miuuto modifications, modified through many generations, produce, iu time, varieties, and varieties, in time, bocomo now species. To a Pagan, observing merely tbo resemblances among all animals, and tho apparent crescendo of intelligence from tho lowest up to man, it would seem as if tho general theory of evolution would bo almost instinctive. Christian theology did not impair tho possible genuineness of tbo theo ry that is, God was as free to create animals derivatively pokntialitcr as to create them all absolutely (/ormaWcr); but Christina theology contributed nothing to ward on affirmative answer to tho problem. It was tho revelation of nature —geology, zoology, and compavativo anatomy—that was lacking. God surely might produce now species remotely from individuals ns to produce any animal proxi matoly from au older one. Tho question is not ono of theology—might Ho do so ?—but ono of natural history— Did Ho do so It Is a more question of facts. If tho theory bo true, it was true iu tbo days of Aristotle, and iu tho days of St. Augustino but it could not have boon satisfactorily dismissed, much less demonstrated, at either period, be cause tho progress of mankind in nat ural science had not supplied facts enough. Had geology uncovered prior to 18110 tho won ders it has since revealed, Cuvier would prob ably have taken tho other sido for if, witji tho knowledge then at hiu command, ho was able to believe tbo doctrine of Catastrophes—that, at different times, all life had boon destroyed by con vulsions, and now lifo been created—ho wo.uld have required loss than half of Darwin’s obser vation to havo made him a Darwinist.

Orthodoxy received the most stun ning blow ever given it, at the hands of Charles Darwin, and it is ever on the lookout for an opportunity to make reprisals. It is only necessary for some fledgling to challenge Dar win's theory of the origin of coral reefs and offer some grotesque as sumption in its place, and it is at once announced from a thousand pul pits that Darwinism,-that enemy of God and man-is dead. HIugo DeVries, however, could hardly be called a fledgling, and the supporters of Darwin had real cause for apprehension, it would seem, when the rumor gained ground that no less a person than the Amster dam professor had overthrown Dar win's theory, and substituted one of his own. Alas, this latest ""death of Darwin ism"" was no more fatal than its numerous predecessors, as the fol lowing quotation from DeVries him self will show: ""lily work claims to be in full ac cord with the principles laid down by l)arwin."" And again, ""To D)arwin was reserved the task of bringing the theory of common descent to its present high rank in scientific and social philosophy."" And, ""Notwith standing all these apparently unsur mountable difficulties, (absence of experimental evidence since gather ed) Darwin discovered the great principle which ruiles the evolution of organisms. It is the principle of natural selection. It is the sifting out of all organisms of minor worth through the struggle for life."" The greater part of the adverse criticism. aimed at Darwinism ap plies only to the extravagant claims put forward not to be found in the I works of Darwin himself. As we shall see later, one of the greatest offenders in this respect was no less a person than the co-discoverer of the selection theory--Alfred Russell Wallace."" Of all the mischievous misconcep tions of Darwin's theory none have worked so much harm as that which regards natural selection as the ac tive and efficient cause of evolution. Although evolution is an estab lished fact, our knowledge of its processes are incomplete and imulst always remnain so until we have solved that most vexed of all biologi cal problemls, the ""causes of varia tion."" As to the nature of these causes. natural selection is dumb. For its purpose, variation is simply assumed to be a fact, and Darwin's acknowl edged ignorance as to how variation is brought about is expressed in the term ""spontaneous variation."" Un til variation has played its part by producing new and various forms, selection has no function or office to perform. Then it simply decides which forms shall survive by destroy ing the rest. As Wigand has pointed out, selection does not do miiore tlihan determine the survival of what is of fered to it, and does not create any thing new. As DeVries very strik ingly puts it, ""it is onily a sieve, and not a force of nature, ino dilrect caiis' of imlproveuellnt, as mally of I)arwill's adversaries, aild unfortunately many of his followers also, have so often asserted. It is only a sieve which decides which is to live and which is to die With the single steps of evolution it has nothing to do. Only after the step has been taken, the sieve acts, eliminating the unfit."" MThus Prof. Cope's point that Dar win's theodry does not explain the ""origin"" of the fittest, is well taken, or as Mr. Arthur Harris puts it, ""Na tural selection may explain the sur vival of the fittest, but it cannot ex plain the arrival of the fittest."" It was around this question of the ""causes"" of variation that the Neo Lamarckians and the Weismannians fought their battle, the former in sisting, as we have seen, that varia tion was caused by the hereditary transmission of acquired characters, while Weismann maintained that variation arose solely through the comlbining of two portions of differ ent individuals, and producing a new individual unlike either,-a ""varia tion"" from both. While whatever there was of victory fell to Weis mann, neither side has experimental ly proven its case, and we are still in the dark as to the ""causes of varia tion."" Our ignorance is still cloaked in the convenient word ""spontane ous;"" to Darwin's ""spontaneous va riation"" we now add DeVries' ""spon taneous mutation."" It is another tribute to Darwin's l caution and insight that he recog nized the possibility of variations: arising either suddenly, as DeVriesI asserts they do, or gradually as Doe Vries denies. Not only did Alfred Russell Wal-I lace seek to limit the operation of; natural selection in certain fields, in order to make room for his spiritlnl-I ist theories--an adventure which failed disnally--but he denied the l sudden appearance of new species or[ sub-species, thereby restricting Dar winisum, as he understood it, to the origin of new species by the gradual accumulatlon of those almnost imper ceptible variations usually described as ""fluctuations."" WVhtever conflict there may be hctween Darwinism and miutation must be ascribed to 'Wal lace. As DeVries clearly recognizes, Darwin is in no way responsible. ""Darwin."" says DeVries, ""recognized both lines of evolution.""",1900: Darwin’s theory of evolution gains national acceptance and his intellectual pursuits are credited for “progressing the country.” His theories are even used in advertisements to promote furniture sales.

How the Colossal Structure, Just Completed, was Erected. The great Eiffel tower at the Paris Exhi bition has just been completed, and a de scription of the colossal structure, with an account of the way it was built, and a sketch of its constructor, will bo appropriate at this time. It is scarcely necessary to say that the U mm Cologne Cathedral, 511 ft. The Eiffel Tower, 9S4 ft. The Great Pyramid, 480 ft. Eiffel tower is by far the highest structure in the world. It presents a decidedly unique ap pearance, too in general outline not unlike a stack of four gigantic muskets with their butts well and solidly spread and their bay onets joining at their tips. The Eiffel tower stands in the Champ de Mars, almost on the left bank of the river Seine, just in the rear of the Quai d'Orsay, and in fact a part of its foundation is sunk through an old arm of the river, which lias been filled in these many years. Its base covers a plot of ground 328 feet square, or nearly two and a half acres in extent. GUSTAVF. EIFFEL. It Ls really at the base a group of four tow ers, each nearly fifty feet square, placed at the corners of the plot of ground, and in clining toward each other as they rise at an angle of fifty-four degrees. Each tower con sists of four columns, bound together by trusswork, and each column rests on a masonry pier which is so built that the weight of the column rests upon it squarely and not at an ancle. As the tower is 0S4 feet high. it will be seen that the matter of providing a solid foundation was one of great importance. There was a lot of boring and digging befon the spot upon which the tower stands was finally selected. The foundation rests upon a thick stratum of sand and gravel. It may be well to say. for the benefit of those who think sand is a rather treacherous sort f ground, that a bed of sand and gravel, away under ground, is pretty solid stuff. One of the towers of the Brooklyn Bridge rests on that sort of base. The foundations of the two piers of the Eiffel tower farthest from the Seine rest on sand and gravel about twenty-five feet below the surface of the ground. These foundations were laid in open excavations, and consist first of great solid platforms of beton, six feet thick, and next of four stone piers which rise to the surface to receive the iron col umns. The foundations for the two piers nearest the river were not so easily laid. It was necessary to go thirty-five feet below the surface of the ground, end this was sixteen feet under water. So caissons had to be used, as they were in building the Brooklyn Bridge piers. A caisson is in effect simply an enormous iron box, without any cover, turned upside down. The method of using it is to dig the earth out from under it and allow it to gradually settle as the excavation pro gresses, meanwhile building the pier on top. When the required depth is reached the cais a .n itself is filled up with the beton, and it forms the bottom layer of it a foundation. A shaft is left running through the pier auove for entrance and exit as the work goes on, and the air in the caisson and shaft is compressed to whatever is necessary to keep the water out of the bottom. It is the prin ciple of the diving bell modified. Work on the foundations was begun on January 28, 1887, and at the end of June they were completed. Then began the labor of setting up the innumerable pieces of iron of which the tower is composed, and it went on at a vapid rate, for each individual piece came from the works of M. Eiffel, at Leval-lois-Pere cut to its exact dimensions, fitted and drilled, so that no modification was neces sary at the place of operations. Up to a height of about fifty feet the workmen re quired no scaffolding to work upon, as each pier supported itself, although each leaned toward the others. Then an artificial support had to le provided, as above that height, un til the first platform was reached, the center of gravity of each pier would fall outside of the base.","1889: The Eiffel Tower opens as a part of the 1889 World’s Fair in Paris.

Tho Actual physic.il oxtont of tho present ex hibition correspondingly goes beyond that f its prcleceior. The exposition covers 103 acres. The gardens of the Hotel des Invalided contain the exhibitions of tho French colonies, of tho several ministers and of social economy. At the Quai d'Orny aro tho halls of agriculture, viticulture, INhorios and general food products. The Trocudoro gardens are given up to fruits and flowers in tho open air and in glass houses.

Already the air is' filled with rumors respecting the exposition of 1900, says a Paris letter in the Philadelphia Tel graph. Already are the moans of the Parisians rending the air beforehand, for it is a Parisian peculiarity to detest world's fairs in general, and those held in their own city in particular. Quoth a miserable native in heartrending ac cents: ""Whenever there is a great ex hibition all our taxes go up-rtempo-rarily we are told, but never by an ac cident do they go down. I paid three hundred and eighty francs in '77, and for the same premises my taxes are now three thousand and odd. We are overrun by tourists; we are crowd ed out of all the theaters; the cabmen all go on strike; the cafes all put up their prices. For several years before all the streets one wants to go through are closed to the public because the ex hibition is being prepared, and for at least a year after the same streets are closed because the exhibition is being demolished. All your country cousins come to town and expect to stay with you in an apartment you have always found too cramped for the require ments of yonr own family; and if I am not lucky enough to be dead I shall certainly move away before this large misfortune falls upon this unhappy place."" tj Happily all Paris is not so pessi mistic as my friend, and the architects are busy with their plans. All the ground comprised in the exhibition of '89 is to be included, as well as the por tion of Cour la Heine that will inclose the Palais 1' Industrie and its surround ing gardens. We are to have an addi tional bridge across the Seine which will open a vista from the Place de la Concorde straight through to the palace of electricity, which is to be the cen tral feature. Our rulers are greatly bored about the Eiffel tower; but as the concession was granted for twenty years it has got to stand; but the arch itects say consolingly that the 7 will try and hide it as much as possible. The sight of it vexes poetio souls, and Francois Coppee, the author, who is, by way of being, sthetio, wrote a formal protest to the government at the time of its erection to request that the plan should not be carried out on the ground that the Eiffel tower, being ugly and ungainly, and furthermore being visible from his windows, inter fered with his flow of inspiration. However, the tower was built never theless, and, although we are deadly tired of seeing it about, Coppee con tinues to write, so evidently his flow ol inspiration was only impeded and not permanently plugged up. Further more, we are to have a branch exhibit at Versailles, which will rouse that sleepy little town from its chief ou pation of listening to the grass grow ing in the streets. In the splendid park of Versailles, on either side of the grand canal, is to be the retro spective history of gardens throughout the ages. The Hanging Gardens of Babylon, that were counted among the wonders of the world, are to be reproduced in miniature; Japanese gardens, Persian gardens, the Italian garden of the renaissance and French and English gardens of different epochs. The Grand canal itself is to be used for the exhibition of one of the floating gar dens cultivated by the Aztecs in Mex ico before the Spanish conquest of the country. The center of the canal is to be occupied by a large island built on piles, with bridges connecting it with the two shores, which is to have aquaria, grottoes and cascades, with cages for aquatic birds, and the great sheet of water is to be additionally or namented, by an exact reproduction of the little fleet of elegant boats that Louis XIV. launched on its surface when Versailles was first built All this sounds most imposing; but we are devoutly thankful that the time for it has not yet come. It is like the 6tory of the philosopher who was to teach the king's donkey to speak in a year's time, on pain of death, and never bothered about the penalty on the crowd tMt the kin? mLrht UJ the ""doSkey ""might' die, or ha himself might die, and whatever hap pened he had a year to the good.

The authorities of Paris have so decreed. This iron spire, the tallest structure in the world, and the engineering feat of the last cen tury, \.i regarded as a dangerous plaything. When a high wind blows from the south the great ribbed structure trembles like a frightened horse. But let a stiff breeze come bowling down from the north and the tower vibrates until the china rattles in the cafes, and to those in the observatory at the apex the sensation is that of a ship fossed by heavy seas. The fact that the tower is more'sensitive to a wind from the north than from the south is regarded as proof of the structural weakness, and from this springs the theory of danger of collapse. It is almost twenty years since Gustav Eiffel began the work of building his sky-scraper. The mark of com pletion was set for 1889, Exposition year, and on March 31 of that year the tower was thrown open to the public. It wa« the leading attraction of the big show, and it has not since ceased to attract attention and coin. The cost of building the structure was more than $1,000,000. Of that amount the French government appro priated $29L',000. Eiffel supplied the remainder, trusting for his reimbursement to the receipts from admission fees and other sources. In this he was not uisappolnted, as the profits of the first year were almost sufficient to make him whole. The lease held by Eiffel will expire in next March, and then, if the present plans of the city fathers are realized, the work of razing the unique structure will be started. The plan is to sell the tower to the highest bidder, the purchaser to be given a certain time in which to remove what Paris regards as almost a public menace. Except as a curio and an Investment for its builder, the tower has been somewhat of a failure. Much was expected in the scientific world from the metaphorical observatory, with its physical and biological laboratories, all 954 feet above ground. But little has come of this, the enterprise having taken on a rather commercial aspect. The Eiffel Tower will ever be considered a colossa* feat of engineering. Tlhese Stria!

Height of the Great Tower as Compared to Some of the World's Tallest Structures. Special Correspondence of The Star. PARIS, May A, 1907. A painter has Just fallen from the Eiffel Tower. Four more men must fall to make the awful average of the most dangerous painting Job in the world?repeated every six years only. They are repainting the Eiffel Tower, and all Paris is concerned about the color, on which depends whether the gigantic mass of iron shall be the eyesore or the glory of the capital. Its first shade was ""dead leaf,"" In 1889. When the sun lit it up to hazy golden with an unreal effect of Jeweler's fragility, even the artists who now corse it admitted that the Eiffel Tower had its nobility. In 1896, after immense discussion, they repainted It orange, magnetic currents even more than light and weather having turned it to a dingy chocolate, heavy and obtrusive. In strong sun the orange showed gleaming copper or red gold. Oscar Wilde declared It magnificent. Puvis de Chavannes threatened to blow It up with dynamite. From this period dated the bad name the tower acquired as a colossal piece of engineering vulgarity, usurping the artistic note of Paris. Then, for the exposition, they painted it ""sun color."" In bright lights the tower became a thing of glory once again. ""All Depends Upon the Faint."" ""All depends upon the paint!"" declares the city's architect, Bouyard, ""a fact which shows the utter inartistic character of the Titan 1^3 intruder. The pyramids ol Egypt were originally cased with gleaming marble; but its present lack does not detract from the artistic appropriateness of the pyramids to their situation!"" The tower gleamed sun color seven years agoi But the atmospheric electricity received every hour since then by such an unprecedented mass of iron reaching into the air so high is Incalculable. Conducting tubes a foot and a half in diameter lead it down the four niles to flftv feet be low the water-bearing stratum; but the effect on the paint la there for every one to see. It does not crack the paint off. The paint simply disappears, leaving the ugly chocolate, the dingy brown of the oxidising iron. It Is the tower's way of ""calling for new victims. Fifty painters, working continuously together, take three months to do a ingle coat Few tourists realise- the immense proportions of the tower, but Parisian!, by experience, show you a peculiar phenomenon of Its deceptive symmetry. They take you In a cab close to the tower. It looks heavy and chunky. It seems sinking into the earth from lU weight. Half a mile distant from that oab the tower grows higher and slenderer. It seems to lift Itself from the earth, like a person rising from his knees. ""Why, It's bigger than before!"" you say. At a mil* distant-It seems quite as near.

The one time police officer hesitated as he entered the execution room. It seemed to the witnesses as if he was startled that the death chair was so near at hand. He looked quickly at the double row of witnesses, glanced at the floor, swept with his eyes the whitened walls of the room and then, suddenly, as if coming to himself, walked briskly over the rubber mat and seated himself in the electric chair. Behind Becker followed the prison priests chanting the prayer of death, which was repeated by the con demned man. ""Jesus, ijtfary, Joseph, hkve mercy on my soul,"" nervously spoke Becker as deputy wardens stepped forward and adjusted the electrodes. Hardly a minhte elapsed before the electrode was applied to the right leg, a slit having been previously cut in the trouser leg from the knee down. After the electrode had been firmly adjusted against a shaven spot on the back of the condemned man's head, the state executioner looked at Deputy Warden Johnson, who surveyed the figure that was ctlll mumbling the death prayer in the chair. Johnson half turned his head and the executioner jammed the switch. Three Shocks Given. The first shock lasted a full minute and the executioner said that it was 1,850 volts and ten aniperes in strength. It came while Becker was still commending his soul to his niflknr. I The two prison physicians stepped forward to examine the collapsed flg ure that sat supported in the death chair by the thick black leather straps. The stethoscope was applied to the heart and Dr. Charles Farr, the prison physician, pressed his finger against the artery in the neck. There was still a feeble fluttering of the heart.' The physician stepped back from the rubber mat and again the electric current pulsed through the body. The shock lasted seven seconds and the current was then turned off. After 4 hasty examination Dr. Farr asked that a third shock be given. This lasted nve seconds. An examination that took several minutes followed. Three physicians among the witnesses then made an examination and Dr.- Farr at 5:55 o'clock proriounced Becker dead. Writes Last Statement. During the night Becker penciled on a piece of paper what he captioned ""My Dying Declaration."" It was tak en to the warden's office where two copies were typewritten, which Becker signed with his fountain pen in a bold hand To Deputy Warden Johnson, who bad charge of the execution in place of Warden Thomas Mott Os borne, who does not believe in the death penalty, Electric Chair Gets Men Who Murdered Rosenthal £L&C7WC CHA/& S/A/G vT/Att ik Lsrry lows which I must die.

This acknowledgment is the only legacy I can leave her. I bid you all good-bye. Father, 1 am ready to go. Amen/' (Signed) ""Charles Becker."" Talks All Night. After his wife had said farewell, shortly after midnight, Becker main tained a casual conversation with Deputy Warden Johnson who sat be side tne screen in front of his cell. Sometimes he smoked cigars, after jwhich he would let his head fall on I his hand and gaze reflectively at the I floor for minutes at a time. Dawn found him seated on the edge of his cot carefully pinning a photograph of his wife on his white shirt just over his heart. Then, as if he desired to have her all to himself, Becker put on a thin black alpaca coat, which he tightly buttoned. The photograph was not seen by the witnesses until the prison"" physician opened his coat as he sat in the death chair. Becker was put to death by the state executioner whose name is unknown to the public. This man succeeded State Electrician Davis and he said he would not take the job unless his name wis kept secret. He lives in a little town up-state and went about his work briskly. Becker's executioner said that in his opinion the man had died instantly at the first contact. Negro Follows Becker. An autopsy on the body of Becker was performed, according to law, im mediately after the execution. After Becker's body had been removed from the electric chair, Samuel Haynes, a nefgro murderer, was brought into the execution room and electrocuted. One of Becker's last requests to Warden Osborne was that''he be put to death before Haynes. Mrs. Becker Makes Statement. A statement credited to Mrs. Becker was given out here shortly after her husband's death. TWO ELECTROCUTED IN KENTUCKY JAIL Eddyville, Ky., July 30—For the third time in the history of Kentucky a double electrocution took place this morning at 3:30 o'clock at the Eddy ville penintiary. The firBt to be executed was Turn er Graham, Jr., 24, a white man, con victed for the killing of R. J. Mc Murtry, sheriff of Hardin county.

Herman Rosenthal, the gambler for whose murder Charles Becker was sen tenced to die in the electric chair, was shot to death by hired gunmen in the early morning of July 16, 1912, in front of the Hotel Metropole on Forty-third street, a few stepB from Broadway. The murder was' the swift culmination of sensational charges made a few days before by Rosenthal against Beck er in which Rosenthal asserted that Becker, then head of the strong arm squad of detectives, freely sold police protection and had accumulated thou sands of dollars of graft money.","July 30, 1915: First police officer to be electrocuted, Charles Becker meets the chair for killing casino owner Herman Rosenthal."

EMIGRANTS RESCUED BY TUGBOATS. Thrilling Experience of Many Persons Just Landed in the Country. SMALLPOX PATIENTS TAKEN FRCM THE HOSPITAL. Exciting: Scenes During: the De struction of Government Prop erty Valued at Nearly a Million. NEW YORK, N. V., June 15.— A fire started in tue biggest of the Government buildings at Ellis Island at 12:30 o'clock this (Tuesday) morning, and, spreading with frigbtinl rapidity, was at 1 o'clock sweeping over the whole island, and it seemed almost certain that every building would be destroyed. Telegraphic and telephonic communica tion was cut off, but the tire had lit the whole bay and every tug with fire ap paratus on board started for the island. By the time the police had started a great crowd had gathered at Battery Park. The flames were then shooting a Hundred tret in the air, and by their light hundreds of people could bo seen on the island rush ing hither and thither. There are usually more than 1000 per sons, most of them emierants, who sleep on the island. The customs officials thought the number there when the tire broke out less than 1000, most of whom arr ved on three ships yesterday. The officials thought tbe boats and men Bent to the island were enough to handle the immigrants who escaped from the burning buildings, no matter how scared they might be. At 1:15 o'clock a great crash was beard, and a moment later there was another tremendous shower of sparks flying into the air. When it had cleared a little it was seen that two walls of the main building had fallen in. For two minutes after this crash the crowds that had been seen on the island rushing around were lost sight of, but when the smoke cleared away it could be teen that a hundred or more tugs had reached the island and wore taking the people aboard. At this time every build ing and every shed seemed to be burning, and there was absolutely no shelter for the people anywhere. The beat was in tense. The whole island is|ooly six acres in area. The unfortunates were forced to crouch, fur on the cater edge until the ho: f'iv J. At 1:30 o'clock thf ferry-boat John G. Carlisle arrive 1 from the island with 200 emigrants and all the sick patients from the hospital there. As the boat got to the pier a crowd made a rush for her. The i police charged on the great crowd and fought their way to the boat, the officer* ot the boat standing on tiie upper deck screaming. ""We've got sraa'lpux patients aboard Go back go bick The crowd retreated pre.uita:ely. The Carlisail the nurses employed on the ilund and by Mrs. Wtiite, wife of the resident phy sician. She said thnt when she boarded the boat she had not heart of any one being injured, and thought all the emi grants got out of the buildings safely. One of the oilu-ers of the boat said the fire originated in one of the lowers of the main building. At the time it started all the emigrants were asleep. The watch men sounded the alarms before they did unytuing towaid tiehting t: c fire, and in that way it :ot such a great headway that j by the time they could turn their atten- j tion to it it was sweeping through the ram shackle buildings utterly beyond con'.rol. Tfie tire was first -een In the northwest corner of the building, which is the de tention building, by Captain W. J. Burke, who is in charge of the night watch. Burke said all the rtoms in the building are connected by an elecric alarm, and that ;ii qu.ckly as possitle he rushed to the main ollice and rang the alarm in all the rooms. This alarm, he said, summoned the eleven men and two women under him. There were at the time 110 in the main building. Cv the time these people got out the whole building, from tower to tower and side to side, was a n.as.3 of swirling flame?, whi h shot hun dreds of feet in the a;r. Within a tew minutes after the fire started the miserable i water supply on the island was almost completely cv: off|v bthe bursting ol pipes which run along inside he main build i ing, so that when the first detachment of police arrived It was impossible to secure a stream of water with enough force to have any effeci. Just directly north of the main build ing stood the hospital in which were lifty-seven patients. Ihe admirable dis cipline of the nurses and medical staff i shov.-ed itself and the fifty-seven patients j were quickly wheeled or helped out of the building. One woman who was nursing a child suddenly lemembercd she had left her baby behind. She beat the air with her bauds and then tried to rush back into the flames. She was held back by tliree attendants. Presently the nurse came around with the baby in her arms. Every official a reporter saw on the i island said positively that no lives had i been lost. Ail the emigants were brought to the barge office lor tne night. Com missioner Seuner said he would person ally furnish a place for all sick emigrants, and the city hospitals would not be asked to take ttiem. Dr. Senner says the building* burned cost the Government $780,000. He does not know what accommodations can be arranged for the receiving of emigrants until they are rebuilt.

Although this is a United States building, it has not been erected under the direction of the Government Supervising Architect's office, but by the architects who received the award In a competition which was open to architects all over the United States. When completed, the new building will furnish roomy and pleasant quarters for the immigrants, where they may be examined, ""assorted."" forwarded or detained, and will In- a great improvement on the present cramped and inconvenient quarters at the Barge Office. The building is about 300 feet long and 100 feet wide. The base is granite, and the building proper is brick, with limestone trimmings The flat roofs are covered with tile and the sloping roofs with copper. The structure is elevated about fifteen feet above the landing pier, and the distance from the place where the immigrants are landed to the main hall is about one hundred feet. This space is a glazed porch which will serve as a protection to immigrants, as well .is baggage, when they are transferred from the barges to the bui.ding. From this light and roomy vestibule the newcomers will go up a large stone stairway to the upper floor. where the Inspections will be made. This room is about one hundred by two hundred feet In size, and its arrangement, the divisions by wire screens, rails an-J partitions, were made after careful study of the experiences at the Barge Office during the last ten years. On the lower floor all the baggage will be taken care of. There will be a number of dormitories on the third floor, and the wings of the building will be occupied by offices. In addition to the main building there will be a hospital, a building containing baths and a restaurant, a kitchen and laundry building, a boiler house, physici ins"" house and ferry houses, and these will all be connected by covered and protected walks. The bull lings will all be uniform in style of architecture and material. The architects, Boring & Tilton, have provided f rroof gardens in the construi tion of the main building These are not positive features of the new building, but the roofs are so arranged that gardens may b built with little difficulty, The contractors are making good progress with the work, and hope to have it completed before next January.

Above this they are of white, hard surfaced plaster. There are no cor ners where a hose may not be turned. The white walls and the dark green trimmings are refreshing to their suggestions or cleanliness. Everything has been so arranged that the Im migrant passes through the station very much after the faanlon of a roll of paper through a web press. Upon landing at the pier he enters a pas sage which leads to the entrance of the examina tion building.

UNCLE S AM'S G ATE WAY FOR THE ADMISSION OF IMMIGRANTS. Lively Scenes When the Living Freight of Several Ocean Steam ers ls Landed-A. Lightning Money Chaager. LTHOUGH a great improve ment on the nightmare ar rangements that need to ex ist for the recep.ion of immi grants who landed at Castle Garden, Ellis Island, says the New York Recor der, is far from being a gateway that .would prepossess arrivals from Europe in favor of their adopted country. The island is tied around from dook to dook with miles of red tape. It is a fearfully tedious matter to land in America and a most unnecessary amount of fuss and feathers seems to accompany the entrance of a new ar rival into the land of freedom. A visit to Ellis Island, when the liv ing freight of two or tbree ocean steamers is being sifted through the various avenues leading to the boat that trasport8 ir to the Battery, pre sents so many phases that it is well worth braving the trip in an immi grant ferryboat from the Barge Office to see the sight. Around the big room in the centre of the principal build ing on Ellis Island where the sifting THE DETE process goes on rans a gallery, and from this a view of the whole interior can he obtained. The first stage through which the new arrivals pass iii the scrutiny of the medical oi?ser.s und the Ellis Isl and matrons. Having proven that they are free from physical defeuts the immigrants are o riven into fenced in passages leading io the registration officials. Through these fe aced avenues the unfortunate steerage passengers, wearing every variety of eccentric and un-American head-gear, and car rying as much portable baggage as they can stagger under, edge their way along foot by foot in the direc tion of the gate of hope through which alono they caa get to liberty. The procession slouches forward at the rate of about a foot in ten min utes, the delay being caused by the laborious attempts of the uniformed official tu extract the necessary infor mation regarding the incomer's birth and .parentage, etc Fortunately the official speaks an almost infinite variety of languages or tho task he has in hand would bc a well nigh hopeless one. AB it is, ow ing to the nervous condition of the immigrant, it usually takes an almost interminably long time to drag out an answer to the simplest question, j Everything has to bo repeated several times and explained in the minutest J detail and then occasionally the ques tioner has to give it up and turn the obtuse foreigner over to au assistant, j But somehow or other the line moves on. Each man and woman IMMIGRANTS AT TE hitches the family belongings along as the space betw?sn them and the man in the brass buttons decreases, and the hope that springs eternal in human breast buoys them up to be lieve that some time they will be able to pass the official who so jealously guards thc-entrance to the open space beyond. Ttn their hands the immi grants clutch the doouments handed to them on boar! ship, for all this questioning and registration at Ellis Island follows a preliminary cross-ex amination before the steerage passen gers are allowed to leave the ship. The immigrants are ticketed, too-a very necessary precaution, for there are several steamship line\ all landing passengers in a promiscuous mass, and without that ticket it would be a Her culean task to sep irate one lot from the other. So, ticketed and registered and served with documents and cross examined and pushed and jostled into place in the line, the hopeful refugee from monarchy-riciden Europe travels slowly into thu premised land. When the immigrant has passed suc cessfully through the ordeal of an swering the sharp catechism of the j official at tho top of the laue, he is handed to the mercies of tho crowd on the outside and thenceforth becomes common property at tho mercy of hotel and boardinghouse runners, rail road agentd, well meaaing but offi cious missionaries, restaurant keeper*, and if he ba lucky enough to have theni, relatives nu I friends He is u luckies* wight during this period of his transition tocitizeuhood. First of al, ho must change hit money. This can bo clone at the island, -where a firm of money brokers his purchased the solo right to money changing. The immigrants* savings are brought from all sorts of extraor dinary biding placee, sometimes from the depths of stockings, from the* in side of waists, where nothing short ol a knife or a pair of scissors CHU secure its release, from shoes and belts, and even from the mouth. To watch Money Changer Scully at work is one of the most interesting sights on the island. The rapidity with which he changes into current coin of the republio Russian roubles, Italian lire, German marks, French franc?, English sovereigns and Aus trian florins is marvelous. Only one glance seems necessary, and the band goes down into oue of tho well-filled cash drawers. Two or three eeconds later and the amount of exchange lies before the immigrant with a paper showing how much has been exchanged, and the bewildered foreigner is told to stand back to make room for the next applicant. He might as well take it for granted that the amount is correct (as, of course, it is) for, if he looked at it with that air of stunned stupidity for au hour, he would not know anything more about tho strange money than before. Occasionally one holder than the rest will make an at tempt to challenge the accuraoy oi the amount given him, upon which an attache of the money changer's office unios PEN. will take the coins from the immi grant's hand and explain the value ot each as he drops it baok again. It is wasted time, however, as the owner of the money is left in as bad condition of dense ignorance a*3 ever. Money will buy things on Ellis Island and the proprietors of tbe lunch counter?, where bologna and bread appear to be the staple articles of food, aro at liberty now to cuargo on the mob made hungry by the long wait in the lines. The scouts for these lunoh counters are indefatiga ble workers and certainly earn their money. The wonder is, from thc way in which the immigrants are almost dragged to the bologua counters, that some one does nob get hurt in the scrimmage. If the greenhorn gets through the experience all right and survives the bologna, lot him brace up to resist the onslaught of the railroad agents, who will bear him off bodily if he does not keep a sharp look out. In this neutral ground at Ellis Island the scene ou a busy day is be wildering and distracting. The offi cials do their be3t to keep the mixed mass of humanity in something liko order, but with so many nationalities, with excited men and women running around looking for their baggage and for each other, children crying and relatives and friends all chorusing a welcome together in various lan guages, it is no wonder that the scene looks like a pocket edition of pande monium. As fast as possible the immigrants are hnstled into the ferry boats and transported to the Battery, and grad [E LUNOH COUNTER. nally the island is deserted by all save tho tired offisials and tho detained im migrants. A sorry-looking orowd is this last. From the detention pen they watch the fortunate ones who .pass the bar rier with envious eyes, looking eager ly at every stranger who approaches them to see if there is not some hope coming from ?some where. In all the driven and badgered crowd that passes to the boats there is none which is not light-hearted, for tho red tape ordeal is over. The prisoners in the deten tion pen have nothing to buoy them up. After eoming all this way to reach this land of promise, they get only a glimpse and are sent baok to the wil derness again. One ol the queerest personages on the island is the barber. It is hardly correct to call his place a shop, for it is merely a corner of the big room where tho barber has placed a chair and hung up a mirror and a towel or two. Judging from the condition of tho majority of tue immigrants, the barber is au institution sadly needed at Ellis Island, but few seem to utilize his services, advertised at the prices of twenty cents for a hair cut and ten cents for a shave. The crematory at Ellis Idand is an other very necessary acsos?ory. Jt is not intended for the cremation ot hu man bodies, but merely to give the clothing of suspicions arrivals a thor ough chance to shake ott any disagree able associations with infectious dis ease or obnoxious insects. Fairly good arrangements appear to i have been made for the bonsivg cf i immigrants who are compelled to stay i on tho island over night, tue old pow THE BARBER'S CHAIR. der magazines having been converted I into comfortable sleeping rooms. One of tho worst Bourses of annoy anoe to the officials are the crowd of relations that flock to Ellis Island to meet incoming passengers. They are always in the most intense state of ox citement and it is all that the gate keepers can do to prevent them break ing down the barriers in the mad rash to get inside of the enclosnre. There being no police on the island it is necessary for the officials to take the law into their own hands and maintain order by force. It wonld be a decided improvement if some of the strongest and most reliable mea on the island were sworn in to act as special policemen. An old landmark of the island is gradually yielding to the infirmitses of age. This is the historical tree on which the pirates, Hicks, Wormsley and Gibbs, were hanged when the* place was known as Ellis Island. The tree was damaged during tue storms of last winter, and has recently been broken off short by the wind. All that is left of the tree now is about seven feet of bare trunk, and this the Eliis Island gardener is making every effort i to preserve.","January 1, 1892 : The immigration station at Ellis Island officially opens."

OOoo! I bet hes drowned, said a small boy in awed and shuddery tones when the man remained what seemed an interminable time beneath the shim mering water of the lake. A small line of bubbles came to the surface. Then larger bubbles arose and a little cloud of mud drifted to tho top. Five thousand shivers ran down 5000 spines. Oh, why doesnt he come up? asked a nervous old lady who had waited HOUDINI, AS HE APPEAED WHEN HE LEAPED INTO LAKE YES. three hours for the opportunity to worry about the fate of the misguided youth.

Aw, hes stalling, shouted an Irre pressible urchin. No hes not. He has to get them shackles off first. He cant swim with them on. This from a bright lad with a wire bridle on his teeth who waited two hours and went home with an autograph which read: Harry Hand cuff Houainl. A man on the landing threw off his coat and ran to the edge of the planks looking intrntly into the water. Hes going to jump, shouted the throng. Hes stuck In the mud.

The crowd never got It straight. More bubbles. More mud. Then Houdini canre slowly to the surface feet first! I told you hed stuck his head into the mud. said the wise guy. Then the feet disappeared.

TbTM biff uatrolmen attended to that little detail. There are some members of the force who would have liked to have defeated the handcuff king even beneath the water. With no free hand to guide him in the headlong dive the mans body shot forward in an almost horizontal posi tion. With an indescribable midair kick he righted himself and made a pretty but dangerously vertical dive. The shutters of 800 cameras clicked In unison and the awful suspense began.

The debate came lato in the session, after other sub jects had been passed upon. The British attitude had been in doubt until the last, but Lord Robert. Cecil turned the scales by announcing that he savv no objection in the amend? ment in the form presented by the President. M. Larnaude, of the French delegation, followed Lord Robert with objections to inserting the Monroe Doctrine. The Chinese also offcred objection to the amendment on the ground that its i language war. so extended that it might validate certain principles and claims J affecting Chinese affairs. Tho President paid thc closest at- tention to the opposition to the amend? ment and jotted down notes for a re? ply. In his speech the President spoke with great enrnestness and with some evidence of feeling. The President declared the .Monroe Doctrine was enunciated t.o combat. the Holy Alliance nnd to hold back the throat of absolutism which was then menacing Europe and seeking to spread its power to the Western Hemisphere. It. served its purpose in keeping this absolute power from the Wesvtern World One of its great purposes, he said, was to raaintain territorial and politi? cal integrity, and. having served its great purpose in the Western World, it now was being brought to the lands which had felt the hand of absolutism and militarism. It was a source of sur prise and discouragement, the Presi? dent said, to hear opposition expressed to such a doctrine and such a purpose. The President's speech closed thc 4iscussion. There was no vote, and, when there were no further remarks, the chairman of the meeting said the amendment would be considered adopt? ed. The commission thi n took up the next article of the covenant. While the text of the .Monroe amend? ment is withheld, its main features are substantially along the following line ""Article X -Nothing in this cove? nant shall be construed as invali dating any agreement, such as th"" Monroe Doctrine, for the maintcnanc of peace.""

Such a league, he says, would involve us in every European quarrel; it would expose the president to the cabals of raonarchs, all closely re lated; it would necessarily result in the creation of an international army powerful enough to coerce any nation, the United states in eluded, of course, which in time might be commanded by a German field marshal, and in, its councils, eacn nation voting as a unit, this mighty republic would have no more influence than Hayti or Liberia. If the senator can-be made to understand that the League of Nations is not altogether a hallucination but a practical conception of international action which is soberly indorsed by many far-seeing men, he will realize that every one of his objections has been or will be answered, the New-York World declares. We hesitate to assume that Mr. Reed has intentionally misrepresented the plan which he as sails, but, plainly enough, he is lll-inrormed as to its inspiration and purpose. The war now ending has shown that never again can wre ignore European quarrels. We did our best some people thought our worst --to keep out of this one, and failed. The nations of the earth are too closely associated to hope ever again to be disinterested observers of war between important belligerents. In that role we suffered many wrongs and humiliations, and the-neutrality of such states as Holland, Norway and Denmark has been hardly less costly than war. A League of Nations has always beenpredicated upon the dls appearance of autoeracyy-which has been the parent of aggresion and strife. The last of the autocrats has gone, and the monarchs of whom Mr. Reed stands in such fear have less actual power than the governor of an American commonwealth. How a League of Nations would arrive at its conclusions and en force them against offenders has not yet been worked out, but we think it must be.taken for granted that before such an organization can be effected the purpose of the world to maintain peace and jus tice will be made known beyond a peradventure, and that, with that common aim once established, the method by which it is to be at tained will be reached without much difficulty. Afterall, it is noth ing but democratic self-government on a large scale, j Inother words, a League of Nations presupposes a membership of free and civilized and not enslaved and savage nations. It must rest also to some extent upon mutual respect and confidence. To be effective it must mckide every considerable nation. Its success will depend more upon the principles of its members than upon any meas ures of disarmament, although it is expected, of course, that in time the great war machines ot the present day will be seen no more. Such a League of Nations as most people have in mind wHl not execute its decrees with the sword, and so Mr. Reed's hideous dream that a German may in time lead an overpowering international force against the United States falls to the ground. Its' discipline in the first instance will be commercial and financial. No unruly govern ment can long survive an international boycott. None but unruly peoples need fear anything more drastic than that. A Leagiie of Nations to Enforce Peace should be no more ter rible to well-disposed nations than the rule of law to communities long subject to assassins, mobs and lynchers.

With cold daring, the actual kid napers crept up a short sectional ladder into the second-floor nur-j sery some time between 7:30 and 10 p. m., took the child down the ladder, and left behind the ransom j demand, a note dropped in the empty crib. Lindy Willing to ray Colonel Lindbergh is willing to pay the kidnapers the ransom they demand, it was stated authorita tively here today, “if they will make known the means and the occasion ! lor so doing.” The note, demanding the $50,000 for the childs freedom, was report ed to have said in substance: “We will be back tomorrow Wednesday to talk business.

During the night he helped to trace | down tracks on his property in the | fastnesses of the Sourland moun tains. During the forenoon he went on a mysterious errand with Lieuten ant John Keaton of the New Jer sey state police. They sed away two men. One of these had approximately size 10 feet; the othei size 8.

Pa.. March 2.—Strong resemblance of Charles Augustus Lindbergh Jr. to his father, and his “hearty dislike of strangers” may lead to early return of the child, his grand-aunt, Mrs. Hilda Morrow- Mellvaine, Meadville, sister of the late Dwight Morrow believes. •The baby looks so much like his father that no one could mis take his identity,” Mrs. Mellvaine said. -And he heartily dislikes strangers. ""I know he will cry and fuss and be unmanageable with his kidnapers, possibly betraying them. “He is unusually bright, walking and talking in a way far be yond his twenty months. His aunt, Miss Elizabeth Morrow, takes him to her nursery school in Englewood, N J., frequently. “After his first shyness he was at ease in the kindergarten, playing w-ith older boys and girls. He even learned to count to five. “He can walk faster than many adults. He has some clever little tricks, too, such as talking on the telephone. If he ever gets into a room where there is a telephone he will persist in taking dow-n th receiver, perhaps giving the operator a clew to his presence.” in a fast car and came back a cou ple of hours later on foot through the woods. Rumor had it that they had vis ited Flagtown where a group of sus pected bootleggers were believed to be. Meantime. Mrs. Lindbergh, deep ly stirred, bore up with the cour age of a Spartan mother. The first word prostrated her, but it was not long before she was ex hibiting the same courage as her husband, and she helped authorities. Once she joined searchers for a short period. Many Clews Traced Her burden was all the greater for she had been nursing the child several days because of a cold. And the kidnapers, without even trying to catch up some quilts, dragged the baby off, clad only in its “sleep er.” Moreover, Mrs. Lindbergh is again an expectant mother. Many clews were run down, only to end disappointingly. Before dawn, a Philadelphia truck driver reported sighting beside the rcadway, not fan. from the Lind bergh home, a bundle which ap peared similar to a baby or a doll. Troopers hurried to the scene on fast motorcycles, but found that all the man had seen was a bundle of papers. More than a dozen motor cars were reported stolen in New Jersey yesterday, and these were checked in the hope of furnishing a clew. The only one which appeared hopeful was an abandoned car found near Hillside, N. J—a car stolen from a Brooklyn man. Its headlights were streaming, and it matched description of a blue Nash sedan in which two men at dark Tuesday inquired at Princeton for the way to the Lindbergh estate. Dog Fails to See Abductors Police thought the inquiries might have been the kidnapers or their advance men. But they were at a loss to reconcile this with evidence that the kidnapers were familiar with the field in which they op erated. A faithful dog, always alert, made no sound, as far as is known, dur ing the visit of the kidnaper to the nursery on the second floor. The man may have made friends earlier with the animal. The kidnaping visit was well timed. The baby had been put to bed and Mrs. Lindbergh had kissed him good-night at about 7:30. Later in the evening, the nurse maid, Betty Gow, was startled to find the crib empty, and the child nowhere to be found. She gave the alarm, and then the authorities were summoned. But by this time the kidnaper had a good start. The ladder the kidnaper used HOME TWO CENTS yielded little help. Evidently he had been gloved, and his feet either were stockinged or his shoes cov ered to blur the shoeprint. The ladder had cracked as he came down, and there is a chance he fell, injuring himself and the child. Had Woman Accomplice His tracks led out of the estate toward the main road, where a womans footprints appeared. This gave the clews that the kidnapers had a woman accomplice, who should watch over the baby until l such time as they could bargain for for their ransom. A chisel was found in the woods near the house, but there was noth ing to link that definitely with the : crime. Workmen who had helped to re build the natural rock house on the mountainside were checked over to ! see if they had knowledge of any i prowlers, but so far as police re | vealed there was nothing yielded, i All the present and past employes were said to have been exonerated. Beside the press and photograph ers, there came scores of autos with the curious, and these jammed the roads nearby for several miles. The milkman arrived at 10:30 a. m., evidently unaware of the kid naping, and delivered four quarts of milk and two pints of cream, most of which was for the little baby. Mrs. Dwight W. Morrow, mother of Mrs. Lindbergh, arrived at the. Lindberg home early this morning to be with her daughter. She mo tored down from her home at En glewood and declined to comment on the kidnaping as she entered the big stone house. Fears Child Will Suffer “The poor child has had a cold and will suffer,” Mrs. Lindbergh said broken-hearted. “We have been doctoring him for several days.” Colonel Lindbergh, quiet but manifestly suffering from terrific strain, said he suspected no one, and observed: “They must have got through that window” pointing to a screened window which would not close because it was warped. Baby Lindbergh was tucked in his crib at 7:30 p. m. His mother kissed him good night, after trying vainly to fasten a loose, warped screen in the nursery on the second floor. About 10 p. m. the nursemaid entered to see that her charge was sleeping soundly. She found to her horror that his crib was empty. She though at first he might have fallen or crawled out. But a search of the room soon showed her that he had been stolen. She screamed to the Lindberghs. The police know only that the in truder had used a ladder, put up in sections, had scaled it into the nursery, and there left a note—a ransom demand for $50,000; then had scrambled .down the ladder, making his way to a point down “Featherbed Lane” toward the main highway. Joined by Woman On this path, according to foot prints, the kidnaper was joined by a woman accomplice. The spot where the kidnaping took place is remote, situated up a rocky roadway off a main thorough fare. Olie Whateley, chauffeur-butler, was convinced the kidnaping had been planned carefully. This con viction arose from the fact that a fox terrier, usually alert, was not heard to make any disturbance dur ing the evening, leading to the be lie that the intruder perhaps was someone the dog recognized.

The kidnapers agent added: “Tell Lindbergh we can hold out just as long as he can.” Seven Notes Received It was learned from an authorita tive source Col. Lindbergh has re ceived at least seven notes from the kidnapers other than the original ransom note which was left in the nursery. The notes, the source said, were sent first to Col. Henry Breck enridge, counsel for Col. Lindbergh, in New York. They bore the same markings as the original. The second note, it was asserted, raised the ransom to $70,000 and the subsequent communications contain ed no other demands. It was stated later than the kidnapers specified the ransom would be raised to $70,000 unless it was paid before April 8. The date on which the ransom was paid was not disclosed, but the treas ury notice to bankers asking notifica tion if any of the given serial num bers fell into their hands was dated April 6. The morning police bulletin Mon day said no further contacts with the kidnapers had been established and there was “no foundation” for the report that Col.

New Jersey authorities, backed by the mighty police power of the federal government, to day apparently were on the direct trail of the kidnapers and murderers of the Lindbergh baby. Shortly after President Hoover had called on the government heads to make the murder of the baby “a live and never-to-be forgotten case,* it dramatically was revealed that Colonel Lindberghs emissaries had been in actual contact with the men believed with out question to be the kidnapers. The revelation came through Dr. John F. Condon, the “Jafsie of the want ads,” who paid out $50,000 for Colonel Lindbergh to the kidnapers, and was double-crossed. Under examination by authorities, he disclosed that the men had sent as a “token” of identification for Colonel Charles A. Lind bergh the sleeping suit they had taken from the kidnaped child.

Through this number Lindbergh traced it to the store where the baby's clothes had been purchased. He felt then Condon was in contact with the kidnapers, and the $50,000 was paid out. When the baby was kidnaped, it wore three garments— a flannel belly hand, a flannel undershirt and the sleeping garment. The sleeping garment was missing from the body. Marshalls revelations recalled one of the series of news paper advertisements through which Condon communicated with the kidnapers. It said. “The package had been received'' and that “the party"" considered it “the real goods."" Betty Go\\. who viewed the mutilated body and positive ly identified it as the Lindbergh baby, was positive because of the undershirt on the body when it was found. It had been too long for the baby and she had cut off the end and sewed a hem with blue thread, Marshall said. Discovery of the pitiful, mutilated corpse, with the skull crushed, at Mount Rose Hill Thursday afternoon, less than five miles from the Lindbergh home, horrified the nation. The child for which the world has been searching for two and a half months was murdered soon after the kidnap ing—perhaps on the night of the kidnaping itself. Mrs. Lindbergh was at home when they brought her the news. Her grief and shock were hidden from the world, al though she was said to be bearing up bravely within the closely-guarded Sourland hills home the Lindberghs had built. It had been planned as a safe retreat in which to rear their child and have their home life. The baby's body was taken to the morgue in Trenton for Hope mounted for the baby's return when Dr. John F.

It was 3:15 p. m. Thursday when a Negro truck driver and his helper found the skeleton in a clump of woods about four and a half miles south of the Lindbergh home near the tiny hamlet of Mt. Rosp. The baby had been killed, appar ently by a blow on the head, and the body secreted in the woods about seventy-five feet, from the road. An attempt had been made to con ceal it in a shallow depression, probably scraped in the underbrush, and it may have been covered up until the wind and rain of more than two months brought it to light to be casually discovered by the hor rified truckman. The body lay face down. The sleeping suit was missing. Two dirty and rain-soaked shirts lay on the shrivelled and decomposed form. The stomach band and diapers were gone. Remnants of the child's blond curly hair clung to the skull. The finder, William Allen, ran back to his truck, informed his companions ar\d the police were notified.

President Hoover today issued orders to the secret service of the federal government to “make the kidnaping and murder of the Lindbergh baby a live and never-to-be-forgotten case.” The President, in a brief, terse state ment, ordered the federal government agencies never to relax “until those criminals are implacably brought to justice.” The Presidents statement said: “I have directed the law enforcement agencies and the several secret services of the federal government to make the kidnap ing and murder of the Lindbergh baby a live and never-to-be-forgotten case, never to be relaxed until those criminals are implacably brought to justice.” Sends Message of Condolence The Presidents message was flashed immediately to all the governments law enforcement agencies, and sudden activity ran like magic through the depart ments concerned. Attorney-General William Mitchell, arriving at the White House for the Friday cabinet meeting, said he had relayed the Presidents message “to all the en forcement agencies under my command.

Hauptmann entered the door of the death house at i-tate prison at 8:41 p. m. The first of three shocks went through his body at 8:42 1-2. Physicians pronounced him dead at 8:47 1-2 p. in. Before his body ever hung loose and heavy against the straps of the electric chair, officials collect ed from witnesses a dozen affi davits, swearing that Hauptmann had died in the place, time and manner prescribed by law. Then they closed their four-year file on the murder of Charles A. Lind bergh, Jr. Hauptmann died without con fessing. Not a word passed his lips as he entered the electrocution chamber and he needed no assistance when he sat down in the chair. Nothing that a man covets — money, security for his family, not even the prospects of escap ing the thunderbolt that hit him last night—could persuade Haupt mann to tell why and how and he kUUd Liodbsrgh baby. His failure to confess left a trail of doubt around the world. Millions, including the governor of New Jersey, believed no one man could have committed the crime, and that the law did only part of its work on the spring eve ning four years and a month from the night when the Lindbergh baby was kidnaped. For these millions, a murdered child still cries out for vengeance and they will believe through all their years that sometime and somewhere a frightened m in is ?oing to whisper from his r'c? h bed that he, too, had a part in the bloody business on Sourland mountain. But when Hauptmann walked to his death he did so in the knowledge that his lawyers and his wife, Anna, had tried and test ed every safeguard' of the law and that he still stood convicted and guilty. For one breathless fragment of a minute last night every heart stood still in the little white-wall ed room where death and Haupt mann met. It was when the door swung. There stood tiauptmann s For five beats of your heart he did not move, but waited for the door to come wide enough for him and his guards to get through. It was his eyes yoli noticed first. They were strange, unblink ing eyes—cold eyes of washed-out blue. They had dressed him for death in a gray shirt open at the throat, in shapeless brown trousers and bedroom slippers. At first glance, only his eyes identified him as be ing the man who sat directly in front of the United Pi-ess cor respondent at FlentSr^ton dur ing the six weeks of his trial. They had clipped the hair of his skull, and it gleamed, white and hard ?n the light. Robert Elliott, the executioner, stood beside a bucket of brine in which he was soaking the sponges to be u:M?d on Houptmann—a wrinkled old mechanic of death, puttering around with his tool?. Thw were more than 60 persons crowded into one corner of the room, hut if Hauptmann saw them th*y must, have been noth ing but a blur of face* to him. Only one thing stands out dark and stark in that white room— the oak chair with its heavy leather straps. And that chair was the fir?1 thing Hauptmann saw aa he canu through the door with a guard grasping each arm. It was not the first time he had looked death in the eye. He saw it down tbc stun by barrel of a machine gun dur ing the World war; saw it coming at him across the fields in the shape of men dressed in French horizon bltse and British brown. But he couki fight back st death then, give it blow for blow and come through, as he did, un scathed. There was no fighting back now, and he knew it. His face was pasty, mayba with fright and maybe only with the pallor that prison puts on men who never see the sun.

Irey, chief of the Internal Revenue Bu- j reaus intelligence unit, was ready not only, to tender Uncle Sam's aid in recovering Charles Augustus, jr., but to question the i women as to their connection with the case. | Through it all Col. Lindbergh held to a de termination to play fair with the kidnapers if they kept faith with him under the solemn contract entered into by Jafsle in the melo dramatic surroundings of a graveyard. In accordance with this “code of honor” Lindbergh requested Irey and his two “aces.” Frank Wilson and A. P. Madden, to remain aw'ay from the actual scene of the $50,000 ransom transaction, but permitted Irey to join in the climactic quest for the baby and its “guiltless” guardians. Respects 8-Hour Start Demand. The kidnapers had demanded eight hours start after payment 1 of the ransom, and Lindbergh, not suspecting a trick, allowed that I period to expire before he launched the hunt for the Nellie off Cutty- I hunk, Mass. ___' me impelling laciur ill caiiaueigus belief that the kidnapers would keep faith was the little package” delivered to Dr. Condon April 1 It was half of an infant's sleeping dress. Col. and Mrs. Lindbergh and Betty Gow. the nurse, were convinced after careful ex amination of the garment that it was, as Jafsie said in a newspaper advertise ment, “the real article."" Stakes All on Pledges. Without waiting to press further his reiterated requests for the babys flnger ; prints, for comparison with a set of ! latent"" prints obtained from toys and ! furniture in the nursery, Lindbergh, with the advice of others, decided to pin all his hopes on the pledges of those who had stolen his son. The babys garment was delivered on Friday, April 1. The ransom was paid the next night by Dr. Condon, who handed to a shadowy figure behind a cemetery wall a box containing the $50,000 in five, ten and twenty dollar bills. Most of the circumstances of that transaction already have become public. The Star now can reveal many of the events that Immediately followed pay ment of the ransom.

Dr. Condon was accosted as he walked along the cemetary wall and he turned the box and its contents over to a man of Scandinavian or Teutonic accent, whom he recognized from previous meetings. designated in the letter soon was recog nized, with a concerted cry of elation. All eyes were strained for a glimpse of the yacht called ""Nellie."" But the Nellie was not there. Nearby, however, could be seen a number of boats, scattered along the inlets and bays. Search in Vain. Lindbergh zoomed down again and again, until it seemed the undercarriage cf the plane would clip the rigging of the boats beneath, or touch the sun tinted waters of the sound. He was try ing to read the names on the sides of the craft that seemed to answer the | general description of the Nellie. I There were yachts with a wide variety i of girls' names, except that sought. Grimly. Lindbergh and his associates j continued the disheartening search. The plane circled the Island and ven- ' tured to ether nearby shores of the ! Marthas Vineyard area. It was hopi-d I the Nellie would see or hear the ! plane and signal to It In some way. j Perhaps those on the yacht had mis understood directions of their own j group and were in the wrong location, j If this were the case it would be ad- j visable to cover a wide territory. With ever-increasing misgivings, the ] plane continued to circle over the j neighborhood. At ope time the plane was landed at the village of Cuttyhunk and the group went ashore and Inquired of the seafaring folk there whether they knew anything of the Nellie. No one had heard of such a boat In that vicinity. Lindbergh Recognized. Lunch was eaten in the village. It was during this visit to the town that Lindbergh was recognized by several of the residents. One of the villagers noticed the name ""Breckinridge"" on a wallet. It was in this way that word of the flight first leaked out. It was not until later that Dr. Condon s identity was disclosed, and the fourth man has been variously reported as having been John H. Curtis. Norfolk ""intermediary"": John Fogarty, private detective, and others. Lindbergh refused to give up hope. All day long he wheeled the plane over Cuttyhunk and Marthas Vineyard. Onlv | the darkening shadows of eventide in - | duced him to call the expedition off j for the day. Crushed with pent-up emotion, the searchers returned sorrowfully to New York that night. Lindbergh could not bring himself to believe he had been deliberately double crossed He argued there must have been some unintentional slip In the ar rangements. Second Flight Made. Tlie first thing Monday he and Col. Brecken ridge again flew back to Cutty hunk and renewed the quest. This trip, too ended in failure. Meanwhile Dr. Condon eagerlv had been awaiting word from his ""contact man.” Tuesday passed, with no message of anv kind from those who had taken the $50,000. On Wednesday. April 6, Lindbergh was prevailed upon to take decisive ac tion He had Dr. Condon insert the ad vertisement asking ""What Is wrong. Have you crossed me?” and he furnished the Treasury with a list of serial num bers of the ransom bills. So far the answer to Jafsie's ad has been complete, poignant silence. Directions to Yacht Given. Dr. Condon was handed an envelop containing explicit directions as to the baby's whereabouts. It was in the same handwriting as that of other letters which played a part in the negotiations and it matched the writing in the original ransom note. The letter instructed Lindbergh to fly to Cuttyhunk. a small island off the “elbow'' of Cape Cod and near Marthas Vineyard. In a certain location along the shore of Cuttyhunk. carefully de scribed so there could be no mistake, it was asserted a 30-foot yacht, with “Nellie' painted on her bow, would be found. On the boat, the letter said, there were two women in whose care the baby had been placed. These women, it was stated, were innocent of any complicity in the kidnaping, and Lindbergh's word was asked that they come to no harm. Lindbergh fully intended to do every thing in his power to grant that plea. In the event that anything went wrong with the plans, however, Lind bergh wranted a Federal officer avail able. Several possibilities of a slip-up had been suggested to him. There was the possibility the yacht would be found, with the women aboard, but no baby there. In this event Lindbergh would have felt fully justified in hav ing the women subjected to a grueling interrogation. Conflicting Emotions. The wave of conflicting emotions that followed reading of the letter of in I struction can only be imagined by those j not present. Hope fought and con ' quered the specter of fear that lurked i in the thoughts of the little coterie j privileged to be in on events leading ! up to the tragic denouement, j Lindbergh and Condon returned to ' the latter's home and picked up Reich i and Breckinridge. Reich drove this 1 group to a place in New York where • Irey w'as picked up. ! It was now nearing midnight. Reich i headed Lindbergh's car north and onto I the Boston Post road. Through the j night the powerful car sped—Reaving towns and hamlets of Northern New York behind them, crossing the State line into Connecticut and on up the coast. The car halted at a Connecticut port on Long Island Sound. Here all but Reich remained hidden until the first streak of a New England Sabbath dawn appeared over the water. Reich mean | while returned to New York with the 1 car. Then the quartet went to the water front and climbed into a big amphibian plane that had been flown there for the purpose. With Linbergh at the con trols, the plane rose over the Sound and followed an arllne course northward to Cuttyhunk. Shore Scanned From Air. The sun was just coming up as the big ship, expertly navigated by an eager father, came within sight of Cuttyhunk. Lindbergh's ryes were glued to the looming shores of the Island that lay Just ahead and below. Other members of the tense group read and re-read the instructions in the note The ship swooped gracefully lower and lower, until the coves of the Ir regular shoreline were close enough for easy inspection.

Hearing jury and judge order him put to death as the killer of the Lindbergh baby, the Bronx carpenter spoke only to comfort his wife.BRUNO RICHARD HAUPTMANN “Its all right. Annie,"" he said. But in the loneliness, the pseudo-privacy of prison which has been his lot for five months, he mumbled unintelligible Ger man phrases. Under state law, he will be held here at least until 11 p. m., Fri day. Then, 48 hours, having ex pired since the warrant for his removal was issued, he may be taken to the death house at Tren ton.

He was sentenced to “suffer death” the week of March 18. and Friday is doomsday in the death house at Tren ton. Edward J. Reilly said an appeal would be carried to the United States supreme court if necessary. The first tribunal expected to hear the plea, the state court of errors and appeals, meets for its next term late in May. The court of pardons will not hear it before October. The Jurors who sentenced him showed more emotion than did Hauptmann as he stood before them at 10:45 p. m. Wednesday. With a look of affection, the 36- year-old prisoner turned to his faith ful wife and said: “It's all right, Annie.” Back in his cell, out of the gaze of the curious, Hauptmann burst into tears. The jurors required more than 11 hours to reach their verdict. They were closely guarded after the case ended, but a courthouse report was that two of the women had held out for a recommendation of mercy. That would have meant a life sentence. There was no mention of mercy when the jury was polled. With stuttering words Foreman Charles Walton, Sr., announced the verdict. He who had listened to the evidence for more than six weeks even twisted the defendants name in his fight to remain calm. “Guilty,” he announced. “We finq the defendant, Richard Bruno Haupt mann, guilty of murder in the first degree.” An insignificant piece of paper rustled in his trembling hands. He glanced at the paper with unseeing eyes in pretense of consulting it. A few strides away stood Haupt mann, jaw set, face so pale and hag gard it was ghastly in the electric light.

Harrison Gray Otis is editor, and princi pal owner, was completely destroyed by an explosion and tire shortly after 1 o'clock this morning, resulting in the death of upward of 20 of its employes and the financial loss of nearly 500.000. The management lays the blame for the explosion to labor unions, with which the paper has long been en gaged in bitter warfare. It is charged that unidentified par-, ties set off the charge of dynamite in a blind alley which ran into the center of the building, wrecking the interior and setting it afire from roof to base ment. J The force of the explosion was ter- rific. It was heard for miles, and all windows in the vicinity of the Times"" building, on First street and Broad way, were shattered. Between 50 and 70"" employes were in the structure at the time, 'and juntil the list can be' checked, it will be impossible to giv.e jjo. accurate list of casualties. TSeads of Paper Have Narrow Escapes. The heaas of the paper, including assistant general manager Harry Chandler, had narrow escapes from death. The building was equipped with gas fittings and the force of the ex plosion, tearing these pipes to pieces, released gas, which ignited in every part of the building. No other cause but that of a dyna mite explosion is advanced by wit nesses, except in the case of the West em Union telegraph operator, ""William Firman, who stated that he detected an odor of gas throughout the building early in the night and called atten tion to it. A few minutes after the explosion the police arrested a man named Harry Pluke, who was making his way through the Broadway tunnel. Another man named William Irwin was arrest ed later, but the police are without clews. Wesley Reeves, secretary to manager Chandler, is among the missing, and it is believed he lost his life. Chandler Makes Statement. ""You can say for me,"" said Mr. Chandler, ""there is no doubt that this terrible outrage can be laid at the door of the labor unions. They have destrojed the building and killed a number of our men, but they can't kill the Times. There is no doubt but that the explosion was caused by a charge of dynamue placed apparently in a little blind alley in the center of the building. It is true the building was equipped with gas, but no gas explos ion could have caused it. For vear3 5 we have been receiving threatening letters from people who said the paper ought to be blown up."" The Times was issued today from the Herald plant and from an auxiliary plant of the Times in another part of the city. Manager Chandler said that two years ago the Times had establish ed aft auxiliary plant, equipping it with a press and 12 linotype machines with the expectation of the present plant some day being destroyed. Many Are Misnlnir. The' dead and missing come princi pally from the composing room, which was directly above the spot where the explosion took place. A number of printers and linotypers are missing and believed to be buried in the still burning debris in the basement of the building. .In the local room, all the editors and reporters had gone home, except two or three men. Assistant city editor Harvey Elder was still on duty when the explosion came. When the flames shot up through all parts Aof the build ing, Elder -was badly stunned, but at tempted to escape. He ran to the win dows opening on Broadway, but there was no fire escape thep, and he was hemmed in by the flames. He jumped. P'iremen below held a net, but he missed it and struck the pavement, dying soon afterwards. Night editor Taggart was at work in the composing room. He leaped through a window and made his way across the roofs of adjoining buildings safely. The entire force of telegraph editors and operators -was at work, ex cept telegraph editor R. N. Whitney. Harry C. Crane; assistant editor, was seen attempting to make his way out of the building, but has not been found among the survivors. Several men wore seen to come to upper windows a few moments after the fire brake out, and were heard to cry for help. Nets were stretched and many jumped to Employes Are At, Many' Are Caught In the Crushed To in the Fire 4- 5 THE KNOWN DEAD.

Others were seen to fall hack into the flames. One Hundred and Fifteen in Building. Foreman Grayblll, of the composing room, estimated toda3' that there -were 115 men In the building. He believes 12 of his men -were killed and the fa talities in other departments about the same number. About 15 men were in the stereotyping department, but. he thinks all of these escaped. Eight women in the proofreading room, on the third floor, also escaped. Says It Was Second Attempt. Assistant manager chandler is au thority for the statement that an at tempt to blolv up the Times plant was made before' the explosion which de stroyed the main office. He said one of his men reported shortly before 1 o'clock this morning that two men were seen by a special officer placing a ladder at the rear of the branch building and were climbing onto the roof. The officer says that, he fired at them twice and the men fled. Chief of Police Galloway said it seemed cer tain that the Times building was wrecked by dynamite. Call Off Labor Parade. Mayor Alexander, the city council, the city attorney, the chief of riollce and other municipal officials met with the officials of various local unions today and mutually agreed, to call oft the union labor parade which was to have been held Monday. The parade was arranged as a protest against the anti-pleketing ordinance. It was agreed that the parade during the present excitement would be unwise. Persons who were first on the scene state that there were three distinct ex plosions. The first seemed to be tho heaviest and occurred under the second floor, which is used as a composing room. The Wrecked Building. The building occupied by he Times was located on the southeast corner of Broadway and First street, fronting about 30 feet on First street and ex tending 75 or 100 feet along Broadway. The main building was- of rick, nrev stories in v height and back( of this jvas a brick annex, two stories and basement. The editorial department was on the third floor of the main build ing. The business offices were on the ground flo""br. The annex contained presses, linotypes, big job printing In the Mornin Work Ire ,the Death Or Which plant and the Times school for training linotype operators. The Times em ployed non-union printers and main tained a large battery of linotypes for teaching and training operators in the use of those machines. Long Opposed Unions. For 20 years the Times has been at war with labor unions, starting with a strike of the members of the typograph ical union employed on the paper. Gen. Otis is on his way back from Mexico City and Is expected here today. Po lice had fire lines stretched around the scene soon after the fire broke out and reserves were patroling the district armed with riot clubs, but the half clad crowd which silently watched the flames from behind the fire lines- was orderly"" 'anSPuotf 'an arrest was made from the crowd. PRESIDENT LYNCH RESENTS f CHARGE AGAINST UNIQNS Indianapolis, Ind., Oct. 1. ""The Los Angeles Times for many years has been a bitter, unrelenting and unreasoning enemy of trades unionism, and it is characteristic of the Times manage ment that, without waiting to investi gate it should charge the disaster to the trades unions,"" said president James M. Lynch, of the International Typographical union, today. ""The typographical union resents and refutes this charge,"" said Mr. Lynch. ""We have always fought fair. The International Typographical union Is not a law breaking, dynamiting In stitution. Its record of more than 60 years' existence Is an honorable one. No one regrets the Times catastrophe more than I do. On the other hand, we are determined to protect ourselves against the opportunity embraced by Gen. Otis and his subordinates to at tempt to fasten the explosion on the trades unions."" President! Lynch said he had wired his Los Angeles representative to take necessary measures to protect fthe In ternational Typographical union and the local union from the charge of com plicity, ""as the press reports convince us the explosion was caused by faulty gas mains and was due entirely to the unsanitary condition of the Times plant."" GOMPERS SAYS HE DOESN'T THINK UNION MEN DID IT St. Louis, Mo., ""Oct. 1. Samuel Gom pers, president of the American Federa tion of Labor said today he did not be lieve union labor members were in any way responsible for the explosrti and fire which destroyed the building of the Los Angeles Times. ""The position of tne Times toward union labor wag well known,"" said Mr. Gompers, ""but nothing has happened recently to make the feeling of the unlon men against the paper more acute. I regret the loss of lives, and destruc tion of property, but see no reason for thinking that union members had any thing to do with it"" FIND BOMB UNDER MAN'S HOUSE, SAY THE POLICE Los Angeles, Cal., Oct. -F. J. Zeechandelaar, secretary of the Mer chants' and Manufacturers' association telephoned the police this morning he had found a charge of dynamite under his house. Police were sent to investi gate and found a bomb. GEN. OTIS, OWNER OF THE TIMES, IN EL PASO FRIDAY Gen. Harrison Gray Otis, managing editor of the Los Angeles Times, was in El Paso Friday on his way home from Mexico City, where he attended the centennial celebration as a delegate from California. Gen. Otis left on tne and was due to arrive in Los Angeles Saturday afternoon at 4 oclock. Two El Paso men, it Is said, were on the Los Angeles Times at the time of the explosion. Al D. Greene, formerly news editor of the old El Paso Evening News, and Eddie Kelley, a printer em ployed, it is said, on the Times, was also formerly employed in the El Paso print ing offices. Henry Aguirre, a pressman, ""who has been employed on El Paso papers was. it is said, working in the pressroom of the Los Angeles Times until two weeks ago when he returned to El Paso for a visit and was to nave returned in timu to resume work Friday but decided to stay here and work on one of the local papers.","October 1, 1910: An explosion tears through the offices of the Los Angeles Times, killing 21 people.

Los Angeles, CaL, Oct. I.—The building and plain of the Los Angeles Times, one of the best known newspa pers of the southwest, of which General Harrison Gray Otis is editor and principal owner, was eompeltely de stroyed by an explosion and tire shortly after 1 oYlock this morning, resulting in the death of upwards of twen ty employes and a financial loss of nearly half a million dollars. The management of the paper lays the blame of the explosion on the labor unions, with which organ izations the paper lias long been engaged in a bitter warfare. It is charged that unknown par-1 ties set off a heavy charge of dvna-1 mite in a blind alley which ran into j the center of the building, complete ly wrecking the interior and setting it on fire from roof to basement. The force of the explosion was terrific and was heard for miles. All the windows in the vicinity of the Times building at First and Broadway were shattered. Between 50 and 75 em-! ployes were Mi the building at the time of the explosion, and until the i whole list of employes of the paper can be checked over it will not be i known how many lives were lost. The responsible heads of the pa- 1 per, including Assistant General Manager Harry Chandler, had nar row escapes from death, many of them having left the building a short time before the explosion. The fire spread throughout the I building with amazing rapidity, and in the course of but a few seconds j the flames were bursting from every j window and door in the building, shooting high above the roof. Xo Clue to Perpetrators. The building was equipped with gasfittings and the force of the ex plosion tearing *these pipes into bits released the gas, which was instant ly ignited in every part of the build ing. There is no other cause than dy namite, is the evidence of witnesses, except in the one case of the West ern Union telegraph operator, Wm. Firmin, who stated that he detected the odor of gas throughout the building early in the night and had called the attention of others to it. A few minutes after the explosion the police arrested a man named Harry Lake, who was making his way through the Broadway tunnel a few blocks distant. He was locked up on suspicion. Another man named William Irwin was arrested and afterward taken to the station. The police are without clues, how ever. Assistant General Manager Chand ler narrowly escaped with his life. His office was on the ground floor and he left a few minutes before the explosion. He is accustomed to re main in his office until late in the morning but last night his wife came for him and he went home earlier than usual. His secretary, I. T. Westley Reaves, remained in the of fice and is among the missing. Says Ijabor Unions Responsible. Speaking of the explosion. Mr. Chandler said: ""You can say for me that there is no doubt that this terrible outrage can be laid to the doors of the labor unions. They have destroyed the building and plant and have killed a number of our men. We do not know how many, but they cannot kill the Times. There is no doubt but that the explosion was caused by a charge of dynamite. No other agency could have caused it. There was no oil in the building, we had no boilers to explode, there was no gasoline in the place excepting a small can or two in the composing room. It is true the building was equipped with gas, but no explosion of gas could have caused it. It was evidently aimed to destroy the plant, and kill as many as possible of the employes. For years we have been receiving threatening letters from people who said that the paper ought to be blown up. 1 have not received any such letters lately, although I have had several telephone calls within the past few weeks, threaten ing us with destruction.'' Had Auxiliary Plant. Two years ago. in anticipation of just such a thing as has occurred this morning, the Times established an auxiliary plant, equipped with linotypes and presses. The Times was issued today from the plant of the Morning Herald and the Times auxiliary plant. General Otis was absent from the city when the newspaper was de stroyed this morning. He is on his Established July 4,190f 5c PER COPY I way back to Los Angeles from The !City of Mexico, where he went some weeks ago as a representative of the United States government by ap pointment from President Taft to the celebration of the Mexican centen nial. General Otis is due to arrive in Los Angeles late this afternoon. The building in which the Times was housed was stone and brick. The part four stories high is of stone, built in ISS7. The six stories of brick were added later. Many From Composing Hoom Ieatl. The dead and missing come prin cipally from the composing room, which was directly above where the explosion occurred. A number of primers and linotype operators are missing and it is believed are buried in the still burning ruins and debris. All but three or four of the editorial staff had gone home but the entire force of telegraph editors and tele graph operators was at work, with the exception of one man, who had just left the building. Those in thp building made their way to the win dows wherever possible, and some jumped to the roofs of the adjoining buildings. Many jumped to the street, but some who had climbed into the windows were seen to fall back into the flames. Owing to the wrecked condition of the building many are believed to have been un able to reach the windows or other exits. Called Off Labor Parade. Mayor Alexander, the city council, j chief of police and other municipal officials met today with representa tives of tbe labor unions. It was re solved to call off the proposed union labor parade Monday in protest against the anti-picketing ordinance and other alleged anti-union labor 'conditions exisiting in the city. It j was agreed that such assemblage in tbe midst of the present excitement was unwise. The city council voted a $25,000 •fund to be used to run down the i perpetrators of the alleged dynamit ing of the Los Angeles Times. The j $25,000 was made available as a re j ward for the capture of the culprit jor culprits. Pressmen Kscaped. The men in the pressroom, which j was in the basement, all escaped. It 'is estimated that 125 men were in the building at the time of the explosion. Two Watchmen Kmployed. The Times employed two night i watchmen but they saw no one about the building to arouse their sus picions. One of the watchmen was jv, B. Glasier. He was not found land it is believed he perished. Tried to Blow Up Auxiliary Plant. Manager Chandler is authority for the statement that a similar attempt was made to blow up the Times' aux iliary plant last night. One of the employes saw two men trying to climb to the roof. He fired two shots at them. The men fled. He inter prets this second attemps as further proof of a carefully planned effort made last night to destroy both the Times main and branch office. Would Blow Up Zeehandelaar. Additional excitement was dis covered in an infernal machine un der the residence of Secretary F. J. Zeehandelaar of the Merchants and Manufacturers' association, who has been active in conjunction with the Los Angeles Times in opposition to labor unions. The machine was dis covered by Special Officer Hendrick son. who. under instructions from the chief of police, placed the ma- chine, which was of clockwork pat tern, in an isolated place. No arrGats have been made. The deadly char acter of the bomb was established by the police and detectives. It con sisted of 15 sticks of dynamite at tached to a fuse with clockwork at- tachment. An attempt was made this after noon to dynamite the home of Gen eral Otis, but nod-image was done.","October 1, 1910: An explosion tears through the offices of the Los Angeles Times, killing 21 people.

Who committed that crime 1 Harrison Cray Otis, pro prielor of the 'l imes, and the capitalist PKBB of the Pacific Coast in general, charge it directly and specifically up explosion whs followed by the charge thai union labor was guilty of the crime as swiftly as the capitalist press could telegraph the indictment to the coun try. It appears well settled in Mr. Otis' statement and the 'limes account that the Times building was blown up by dynamite, and equally well settled that the crime was committed by labor unionists. As one who knows the Los Angeles Times by personal experience with that vicious, lying and criminal sheet I want to express it as my de liberate opinion that the Times and its crowd of union haters are themselves the instigators, if not the actual per petrators of that crime and the mur ders of the twenty human beings who perished ns its victims. First of all, let me relate my own experience with General Harrison Otis nnd the Los Angeles Times. At the time of the railroad strike in 1894, the Los Angeles Times lied about me out rageously, charged me with every con ceivable crime, editorially stated that 1 deserved the gallows and did all in its power to send me there. Shortly nfter the strike I went to Los Angeles to give a public address. The following morning the Times had a column of editorial abuse and vilification the like of which has randy appeared in public print, but not a word of my address. I was charged with arson, conspiracy, treason. murder, and assassination. There were in this villlanous article thirteen deliberate, clear-cut. mnde-to order, montsrous lies. 1 nt once con cluded to return to Los Angeles nfter filling my immediate engagements nnd make answer to this outrageous indict ment; and here let me ssy that any man who would make such false and fiendish charges against another to glut his insane hatred of organized labor would commit any other crime to serve the same base end. A few days later I returned to Los Angeles to find the old Hazard's pa vilion packed to the doors, every inch of stnnding room occupied nnd thou sands turned away, to hear my answer to Otis and the Times. It so happened that I had in my grip the documentary evidence, including government reports, to prove my innocence of the most vicious of these charges. In one hand I held up the Los Angeles -Times and in the other the positive proof of its criminal mendacity. I went through the thirteen charges seriatim and liter ally tore them to tatters. I had not proceeded far »nt>\ some one in the audience shouted, ""Otis is In the house,"" and this proved to be true. I at on'-e challenged General Otis to come for ward nnd face me, whom he had so out rage lonely maligned, before his own people. It is needless to sny that, al though the crowd yelled ""Otis, Otis, Otis,"" he did not dare to come and he would gladly have disappeared if the packed nnd Jammed condition of tha hall had not barred his escape. But from that day to this, although their monstrous lies have long since found them out, General Otis and his keproUS sheet have never uttered one word of retraction, and it is not their fault that I was not lynched or hanged for crimes of which 1 was as innocent ns are the union men of Los Angeles upon Whom General Otis is now seeking to fasten his atroeioias calumnies as he did upon me and my fellow-union ists fifteen yenrs ago. Now let us examine some of the facts in regard to the blowing up of the Times and some of the circumstantial evidence, nnd let us see if it is not im possible to escape at least the inference, if not the positive conclusion, that Otis and his gang are themselves the con spirators and criminals. The theory that he who is benefited by a crime is most apt to have a hand in its commission is peculiarly appli cable to this case. Financially and morally Otis and the Times have every thing to gain as certainly as organized labor ban everything to lose in bearing the crushing odium of the crime. 1/ot it Ik- remembered that General Otis was perfectly certain that the outrage, si most before it was committed, was the dnstardly act of union laW. He per sonnlly was at a safe distance, and all th* vie tims were wage slaves, and what do Otis and his crowd of exploiting plutocrats care sbottt the lives of slaves* Vow for a few of these facts: First, The class war on the Pacific Coast had reached it* acntest stage and EVERETT. WASHINGTON. FRIDAY. OCTOBER 21, 1910. was rapidly approaching a grave crisis at the time of the explosion. It was in striking analogy to the blowing up of the Independence platform in the class war in Colorado five years ago, nnd we now know beyond the shadow of a doubt what side committed thai re volting crime and what was its ob ject. Second. The tide of organised labor in California was steadily rising, the Socialist campaign was in full swing, and there was to be a culminating 'demonstration of the united labor forces [at Los Angeles but a few days after t'ho Times was blown up. This dem onstration was promptly called off by 'the leaders of the unions, a grievous blunder on their pnrt, which places them in a defensive nnd apologetic at titude utterly unwarranted by the cir cumstances of the situation. Instend of pleading not guilty to the criminal charge preferred against the workers, without a scintilla of proof they should have immediately accused Otis nnd his gang of union-haters nnd called upon them to prove that their own hands were not red with the crime. Third, Tho l\os Angeles Times is the most venomous foe of organized labor in the United States nnd its own record prove* that there is no crime too nl> horrent for it to commit to wreck its vengeance on the labor movement. Fourth, The statement is made by the Times itself and confirmed by press dispatches from Chicago that General Otis, ""having antlcipatd just such an eventuality."" hnd a duplicate printing plant and n duplicate working force in reserve, all in readiness to leap into the breach nnd rescue the paper when the expected bomb exploded. This admis sion proves too much. It is fatal to Otis and file Times. What cause had Otis to anticipate the explosion nn.l prepare for it? Suppose a labor union ist had made such an admission, or even intimated that he knew the ex plosition would occur, would he not promptly be arrested on suspicion nnd lodged in jail? Yes. we are only too ready to be lieve that Otis and his pals expected the explosion and were entirely pre pared for it when it came. Fifth, The united league of newspa pers which embraces a chain of daily papers scattered over the country, and friendly in their attitude towards or ganized labor, recently sent a special cor respondent to California to investigate conditions growing out of the war be tween lalior and capital on the Pacific Coast, nnd his series of articles is now running in those papers. These articles describe a situation and a desperation on the part of the capitalists that has a fitting climax in the blowing up of the Times, as the same war had in the blowing up of the Independence plat form in Colorado. In the second article of this series-— and let it be remembered that these are capitalist papers and not Inlaw papers the capitalists composing the manu facturers' association are described as in a state bordering on frenzy in their determination to utterly annihilate ""at any cost and at all hazards"" organized labor on the Pacific Const. The chnir innn is personally quoted as saying to the correspondent representing these capitalist newspapers: WK WILL NEVER CEASK UNTIL THE LAST VESTIGE OF UNION LABOR HAS BEEN WIPED OFF THE PACIFIC COAST."" This vehement and bloodthirsty de claration was made only a short time before the Times was blown up nnd the united workers, a few days later, were to have their mnminoth demonstration. Sixth, The discovery of the I ib is the one fareinl feature of this grue some tragedy, which every human being not utterly void of feeling must de plore with all his heart. To prove that it was the fiendish plot of unionists, other bombs, accessories to the crime, and |Kinting to the identity of its per petrators, must Ik- located and un earthed. Of course it was known in stantaneously where to look for the bosahs, and of course they were sll found according to specifications. In each case they were located at the pal ntial homes of the proprietors and man SMS of the 'limes and the manufactur ers' association. BUT IN NO CASE DID ONE OF THESE BOMBS EXPLODE. The bomb that did explode blew up the wage slaves of the Times only; the bombs that did not explode did not blow up any of the aristocratic owners and managers. there is a peculiar bomb consciousness in evidence here flint clearly draws the line between capitalists and wuge workers. In Chicago following the Haymarket riot a regular crop of bombs was har vested in plutocratic reservations until finally the thing was overworked by (Continued on Page Four.) of Organized Labor","October 1, 1910: An explosion tears through the offices of the Los Angeles Times, killing 21 people.

This afternoon the attorney for the Structural Iron Workers in In dianapolis made the charge that the private papers of the international association were seized by Detective Burns and turned over bodily to the Erectors' Association, the manufacturers' organization, which Is financing Detective Burns In this fight The papers have been ordered returned. In Chicago it Is understood that Manlgal, arrested as the ag of Secretary McNamara, are still being concealed there by officer' j who fear to start them on the journey for Los Angeles. Labor Leaders Brand Arrest of McNamara As ""Infamous Outrage"" Applying tho brand of ""infamous out rage"" to the arrest in indlanapolU last night of John J. McNamara, interna tional secretary of the Bridge and Struc tural Iron Workers of America, official.? of the American Federation of Labor today declared that the charge made against McNamara of complicity in the dynamiting of the Los Angeles Times office Is nothing more than another at tempt of capitalists to discredit organ ized labor In the eyes of the world. That dynamite was ""planted"" In the barn near Indianapolis and hidden in the storerooms of the Iron Workers' Union building by opponents of unions, anxious to make evidence against them. Is the belief of such officers as Presi dent Samuel Gompers and Secretary Frank Morrison of the American Fede ration of Labor. The same belief Is held by William J. Spencer, secretary of the building trades department of the American Federation of Labor and a personal friend of the accused official. ""Legalized Kidnaping."" Forceful words were used by the American Federation officials in their endeavor to express their contempt for tho Injustice they believe has been done Secretary McNamara in spiriting him away from Indianapolis without, grant ing him legal representation, or even communication with his friends. ""How long are the American people going to stand for legalized kidnap ing?"" With this query Samuel Gompers. president of the American Federation of Labor, today declares his belief in the innocence of union steel worker, arrested at Indianapolis for alleged complicity in dynamiting outrages. Angrily and Indignantly, President Gompers charges the arrest to en emies of organized labor, a plot to destroy labor unions by huge money Interests. He characterizes the sum mary removal of McNamara from In dianapolis to California as ""high handed legal kidnaping."" ""McNamara's extradition is a gross ly outrageous piece of legalized kid naping,"" 6aid President Gompers this morning at his home, 2122 First street northwest. In Class With Haywood Case. ""Nothing except the Haywood, Moy er, and Pettlbone case equals It in the besmirched history of attacks upon organized labor,"" said President Gom pers. ""McNamara was spirited away with out giving him the slightest chance to gltfe prima facie, evidence of his Innocence taken from hi3 own home and State without aid of friends or attorneys,"" President Gompers con tinued with passion. Declaring the arrest of the union men ""smacks of theatricals,"" Presi dent Gompers said.

The only vestige of information obtained so far bv McNamara's friends has been that the journev to Chicago, whether completed yd or not. Is bv automobile, evidently so that the route cannot be foreseen and legal obstacles made. On one point the labor leaders arc Jubilant. All last night and up to the parly hours of this morning the officers of the International Structural Iron Workers fought the efforts of Detective Burns to open the safe of the organi zation, which was used by McNamara as secretary-treasurer. But in spite of their opposition Bums finally had thi safe blown open early this morning, only to find not the sllchtest bit of evidence against the accused. Bums himself ad mitted the failure, this morning. Pacific Coast Leader Sought From Los Angeles has come the well accredited report that a warrant has been issued for still another noted labor leader, this one a Pacific coast leader, charging htm with being the Pacific coast manager of what the Burns men call the dynamite conspiracy. This man Is expected to bo under arrest before night. It is known to the labor leaders here that the other two men who are under arrest In connection with the affair James W. McNamara, of Cincinnati, brother of Secretary McNamara. alias J. B. Bryce, and Ortle E. McManlgal. of Chicago already are on their long trip to Los Angeles, in the custody of Los Angeles police. In spite of the failure of Burns to find any evidence In the safe at headquar ters, and in spite of the failure of two of his men, Shlnn and Dugan. to find anything Incriminating In a search of McNamara's room, so far as can be learned, the whole Burns force Is Jubi lant today over the two discoveries of dynamite, one in the basement store room of the iron workers' building, and the other in the barn In the outskirts of the city, owned by T H. Jones. They point out that the evidence of Jones is the strongest of all yet brought out. He is an Iron worker himself, and told his story reluctantly. It Is to the effect that he rented his barn In Janu ary to McNamara for J23 a month and had frequently seen McNamara and others going and coming to the barn with heavy suit cases. Fight to Get At Safe. The blowing of the safe of the Inter national Structural Iron Workers early this morning was accomplished only after many difficulties. When the de tectives went to the union headauarters in the American Central Life Building last night. President Ryan, of tho Inter national Union, was ready for them, and was prepared to fight.

McNamara's confession clears up absolutely the tragedy ot the explosion and lire which, at 1:07 o'clock on the morning of October 1, 1910, wrecked the plant of the Los Angeles Times, at First and Broadway, and caused the death of twenty-one persons. For nineteen of these ""deaths the McNamara brothers were indicted, and I. B. McNamara was on trial specifically for the murder of Charles .1.

To this opposing counsel gave the same answer. Confessed Because of Guilt ""He confessed because he was guilty, and that's all there is to it,"" de clared District Attorney Fredericks. ""He was counseled to confess because that was the best thing he could do in opinion of counsel,"" said Attorney Clarence S. Darrow, chief of coun sel.

Burns left Chicago tonight to take up anew the trail he hopes soon to end with the arrest of every man con nected with the McNamara dynamiting gang. The detective refused to di vulge his destination, but it is believed he went to Indianapolis. Before his departure he intimated that the result of the guilty pleas entered by the McNamara brothers might mean further arrests in San Fran cisco. He refused to make predictions as to when the arrests would come, ""Burns is still on the job,"" he said, with a smile, as he brushed a pile of congratulatory telegrams aside and picked up a telephone to give several last orders to subordinates in Chicago. ""We've got the evidence —overwhelm ing evidence —to prove just who was concerned in this entire matter, and we 11 get the men before we quit. That's about all I can say."" ""That means the men who employed the McNamara gang that blew up the Los Angeles Times building?"" was suggested. ""Do you know them? ""We know who they are.

""Do you think the discovery of the jury bibery plot in Los Angeles had anything to do with the pleas entered by the McNamaras?"" he was asked. ""We have all the facts in connection with that plot,"" he answered, smiling. ""We know all about it."" The detective said the statement of Attorney Clarence Darrow to the effect that James B. McNamara declared he did not expect such a heav> explosion and insisted that force was greater because of a co-ordinate ev plosion of gas. was in keeping with the confession of Ortie McManigal, who helped commit the crime. Knew Part of Explosion Due to Gas ""Why, McManigal told us in his first confession that McNamara turned open the stop cocks on ihe gas mains of the building when he set the bomb,' the detective said. ""We knew all the time that a part of the explosion was due to the gas, but they had plenty of dynamite and nitroglycerine there to wreck the building, at that. They tried to buy 90 per cent, dynamite to do the job, and when told that 85 per cent, was the strongest they could buy, they got that. The statement that ten or twelve pounds of dynamite was all they had may or may not be true. They had hundreds of pounds at their command."" Says Samuel Gompers Lied Speaking of Samuel Gompers. against whom the detective has the most bitter feeling because of the labor head's denunciation of the detective and his methods. Mr. Burns said: ""Gompers knew from the first that 1 never made a 'plant' of dynamite, as he has charged. How do 1 know? Because Clarence Darrow told him so in Indianapolis immediately after the arrests were made. Darrow told him right then that Burns never 'planted' the dynamite and that 1 had a case."" Fight Has Only Begun NE W YORK, Dec. 2.—""The fight has only just begun. This is only the lirst chapter. What we want to find out now is who were the men behind the McNamaras. and this we purpose doing."" This statement was made today by Walter Drew, chief counsel for the National Erectors' association, which employed William J. Burns and his detectives to investigate the Los Angeles dynamiting case. ""The McNamaras in pleading guilty have said that they were sent on' there and acted for a principle,"" Mr. Drew continued. ""It is obvious that the men representing this 'principle' have kept them well supplied with money. It is to find out who these men are that becomes the important issue from now on."" McNamaras Only Tools ""The McNamaras,"" continued Mr. Drew, ""were merely tools of a coteri. of men who attempted by force to coerce builders of structural steel an bridges into maintaining a closed shop and as hirelings they had no interest, whatever in committing murder or blowing up property further than to s j do their work as to draw their pay. ""Their crimes are nominal compared to those committed by the men wh sent, them lo do these jobs and who paid for murdering men and destroying j buildings and bridges with high explosives.

The government with stern, decisive swiftness today took into possession thirty-eight union labor officials, convicted of conspiracy in prompting explosions on non-union work through out the land, aiding the destruction which brought the loss of life at Los Angeles and carrying on a ""reign of terror,"" declared to be unparal leled in the history of the country. Almost the entire executive staff of the International Association of Bridge, structural and Iron Workers was convicted. Only two- offi cials of that union now remain out of jaiL At the head of the list of those convicted stands Frank M. Ryan, the president It was in this Union, with its twelve thousand members, that John J. McNamara was Secretary-Treasurer, while, he conducted the dynamitings out of which the present convictions grew. Today's convictions, on a scale unprecedented in a Federal court are the aftermath of the killing of twenty-one persons in the explosion of the Los Angeles Times. McNamara and his brother, James B., the Times dynamiters, convicted in California, are now in San Quentin penitentiary. Ryan and his fellow officials, the former associates of McNamara, are now Federal prisoners, awaiting sen tence. Two convicted, not affiliated with the Iron Workers, were found guilty of promoting the conspiracy. Sixteen minutes in all was the time required by the court to re ceive the jury, read the verdict of ""thirty-eight guilty"" and dismiss the jurors. The verdict brought to an end the history of the dynamite trial. It meant, except in the cases of Herman G. Seiffert, of Milwaukee, and Daniel Buckley, of Davenport, Iowa, the two found ""not guilty,"" that the government's charges about the dynamite plots extending, over six years, were sustained. I'meant. also, that thirty wives, -Inany with"" their children, who -sat patiently through the long ordeal, would at last be separated from their hus bands. Important details yet remain in consequence of the verdicts. Pun ishments are to be imposed on the thirty-eight men by Federal Judge Anderson Monday morning at ten o'clock. The prisoners who receive terms longer than a year will be taken to the Federal prison at Leav enworth, Kansas. A special train will take them by a secret route. Details as to its leaving Indianapolis and arrival in Leavenworth will not be made public It is learned that United States Marshall Edward Schmidt, who is to accompany the prisoners, already had prepared for; the special which will leave as soon as possible after the sentences. A delay in the arrangement may be caused by appeals which may actj as a stay of execution of the court's j judgment. Thirty-nine and a half years is the maximum punishment for any one prisoner in this case. It may vary from the maximum to any shorter imprisonment or fine the court wishes to impose. Motions and appeals will be made Monday. Senator Kern, now in Washington and William Harding, another attorney for the defense, stated motions in behalf of all the men will be offered. District At torney Miller said he would oppose any appeals for light sentences in the cases of certain prisoners. To night the prisoners, four in each cell, otcupy two tiers of cells in the Marion county jail. The prisoners were handcuffed after the courtroom was cleared of spectators, and be teween deputy marshalls, marched five blocks through the streets in the brilliant winter sunlight to the county jail. An hour after their ar rival they were served the regular noonday meal, a half loaf of bread, tin of coffee, beef and cabbage. The prisoners, visible one to another through the bars were variously downcast and cheerful. Some pro fessed to take the verdict in light spirits, while disappointment was plainly written on the countenances of others. Extra guards were placed about the jail to prevent a demonstration by crowds. Wives and children of the prisoners were ordered with oth er spectators out of the court room where some wept when the verdict was rendered and attempted to climb the railing separating them from their husbands. Later in the streets they struggled through the crowds trying to follow their husbands to jail. All the afternoon .attorneys and women relatives .divided the time of the prisoners. President Ryan wss interviewed in the jail tonight. ""I have nothing to say but this,"" said Ryan. ""Greater men than we have been incarcerated. In olden time they cut off the ears of honest men."" The Los Angeles Cases. LOS ANGELES, Dec 28. ""What will be done with McManigal"" was the question put tonight to District Attorney Fredericks who prosecut ed the McNamaras. ""That will be a story for another day,"" Fredercicks answered. ""He will be back here soon, but I cannot discuss him now. I will say though, that without his testimony and as sistance tLere would, have been no case at Indianapolis.'' Federal officials said the three in dictments of four counts each which alleged the illegal transportation of explosives against Tveitmoe, Clancy and Munsey, returned a year ago here, are still in effect. Action has been postponed from time to time, awaiting the result at Indianapolis. They are now due to come up in the Federal court on January 13th, but their disposition either as to dis missal or setting for trial, depend up on the orders of Attorney General Wickersham.

It was a scene blended with tragedy that confronted those who week after week sat through the historic dynamite conspiracy"" trials. Now it was a baby crying from the rear of the court room, where the wives and children of the de fendants sat; now it was the heavy voice of a man seated in. the wit ness chair and defending .himself against the charges of a nation-wide conspiracy, in which officials of union labor were 'deeply concerned. Wit nesses from near and far came and went, but those whose fate rested with the jury remained there, listen ing to the accusations and to the oft-repeated story of the killing of twenty-one people in the Los An geles ""Times"" explosion. The court room itself seemed a fitting setting for that sombre story. Surrounded by great marble pillars, with the daylight shut out by heavy curtains, and the judge installed be fore an allegorical painting of Jus- tice, that court room day after day echoed the stories of violence, of the discovery of burnt fuses and bursted infernal machines, of mid night visits of mysterious men in alleys, in empty houses, in lonely country roads, or on the tops of buildings. The vision of a dark spectre with a bomb under his arm became a familiar image in the minds of those who listened.- Back of the railings, amid the spectators, sat the relatives of the defendants. Three rows deep across the room were the defend ants. Among the the score of at torneys sat perhaps the most pictur esque defendant, massive in build, florid in complexion, always studi-' ously occupied, now copiously filling his note-ljook when the testimony was exciting; now, when the trial lagged, burying his spectacled nose in a Latin version of Omar Khay- yam. He was Olaf A. Tveitmoe of San Francisco. Another in toward whom the eyes of the spectators often strayed was Herbert S. Hockin. He sat apart, between bailiffs, during much of the trial, for he had been branded by the court as. a man who could not be trusted by any one."" It was Hockin who was named as having promoted the dynamiting business; it was Hockin who was accused of ""holding out"" on the pay of the dynamiters; it was he who was said to have caused a quarrel in the ranks of the McNamaras and McManigal, and it was he who finally was charg ed with betraying for his own gain"" those with whom he once associated, and with whom he was affiliated in the iron workers' union.

For the past 30 years of As nearly half a century in prac tice, Jerry Giesler has been the courtroom marine corps, the legal gladiator, who has beaten back again and again those most terrible of threats to stardom: Shame, scandal and prison terms. Marie (The Body) McDon ald was the latest to utter the traditional movie colony cry of desperation—“ Get Giesler!"" —when her account of kid naping and half-clad aban donment in the desert was met more with suspicion than in vestigation.

At first sight and sound, a courtroom spectator or pros pective juror might be inclined to smile, to feel that here is a successful but perhaps slightly too-dapper small-town busi nessman.

His voice is thin, high-pitched and seem ingly always on the verge of cracking, but it never quite does. Picture of Dignity These first impressions are swiftly forgotten, however, as he goes into action. Then the Jerry Giesler of legal renown becomes clear. His pale blue eyes convey at once the as surance of full and complete frankness and honesty. In court he is the picture of dignity. No witness ever is heckled or badgered with sar casm. no matter how greatly the counsel might be tempted by the situation. For behind Jerry Giesler’s extreme courtesy is a keen mind, deftly leading the wit ness down a seemingly inno cent path of interrogation to the brink of disaster.

This great painting, also known as ""La Giocondo"", has been pronounced by many the finest in the world. It certainely stands in a list of the world's half dozen greatest paintings and in popular regard perhaps ranks second only to the ""Sistine Madinna"" by Raphael. Some think ""The Last Supper,"" also by Da Vinci, greater than ""Mona Lisa,"" but this sort of comparison is fruitless, as the two paintings are quite different in the subject and treatment. The loss of this picture is regarded by the FRench as a national calamity. To them it is not only priceless, but a part of their very life. It has been reported, and is probably true, that the French government once refused an offer of $5,000,000 for the painting. Upon its dissapearance the Louvre was closed for several dats, a large force of police was set to work searching every nook and cranny of the great building, and sixty detectives were started working on the outside. One of the theories of the authorities was that the theif was a young man who was known to have become enamored of the painting and who had visitedit at intervals for several months, sitting before it with a rapt expression for hours together. They believe that he fell in love with the face, as painters have been known to become enamored of their own works, and grew insane upon the subject, his mania finally prompting the crime. So much people were affected by this masterpiece that some shed tears at sight of it. Not a few letters have been received at the Louvre addressed to ""Mona Lisa"" and expressing love to her as to a living person. That the deed was the owrk of some deranged person seems almost certain for the reason that the picture could not be disposed of and hence would be without value of the thief. A painting is only valuable when shown. If the criminal could dispose of i to a private collector and it cannot be conceived that any thief would dare to offer it for sale or that any collector would be so foolish or depraved as to buy such collector would not dare exhibit it for fear of detection. While there are many copies of the painting that the average man could hardly detect from the original, there are always those who can distinguish and now that the whoel world is on the lookout for the picrure every copy will be subjected to closer inspection. Moreover, an old master is chiefly valuable because it is an original, and to be able to refer to it as such and to know in his heart that the claim is true constitute its chief value to the collector; hence insanity of one form or another is the only rational explanation of the act. That paradox and all. An interesting fact in this connection is that several months ago it was reported in the public print that ""Mona Lisa"" had been stolen and a copy substituted in its place. This was afterward denied, but the dissappearance now makes it seem a strange coincidence, almost a prophecy. There is one other possible explanation. It is notorious that in Europe the trade of making fake ""old masters"" flourishes apace, chiefly for the purpose of guilling American millionaires. These copies are properly aged by processes that the fakers know and are then sold for fabulous prices to those who have more money than expert knowledge or perhaps real appreciation of ""old masters."" To do this work fakers have to posses originals in order that the copy may be as nearly perfect as possible. Sometimes these imitiations are so close that they fool even the experts. Many pictures have been stolen in the past, but none even approaching the values of ""Mona Lisa."" The most famous case in modern times was the theft of Gainsborough's famous portrait of the ""Duchess of Devonshire."" The ""electioneering duchess"" she was called, having been active in her husband's political canvasses. This painting was missing nearly a quarter of a century and was finally returned through the instrumentality of the late Pat Sheedy, the ""square"" gambler. Sheedy's version of the affair was that the theif was Adam Worth, whom Sheedy regarded as the greatest criminal of the last century. The painting wasoriginally stolen to be used in an effort to get one of Worth's accomplices out of jail. The man escaped on a technicality, however, and Worth had the picture on his hands. He did not dare to sell it or even to mention its existence. The painting was kept in a hermetically sealed case in the false bottom of a trunk. The Pinkertons, believed that Worth wasthe thief, but could not prove it. This is where Sheedy came into the case. Worth had at one time done Sheedy a kindness-$2000 worth of kindness, to be exact. Pinkerton heard of this and asked Sheedy that if he ever saw Worth again to find out about the Gainsborough. Some years later, when Sheedy was running a gambling joint in Constantinople, he received word from Adam Worth, who was in trouble, as usual. Sheedy, of course, more than made good the former loan and got Worth out. He then mentioned the matter of the Gainsvorough, and Worth replied that he was on the point of breaking the ice on that subject himself. The upshot of it all was that Sheedy acted as a go-between got the picture out of the false bottom of the trunk where it was in storage in Boston, had the British owners over to examine it, collected the $25,000 reward, presumably turned over the money to Adam Worth and his pals and as a result of the incident got into ""art"" himself. Worth was so grateful for Sheedy's action in the Gainsborough affair that before his death he insisted on giving Pat an original Murillo which had been stolen out of some monastery. When this came into his hands Sheedy tried to find the rightful owners, advertising extensively in South America and elsewhere, but failed. Some years later he heard that Raisuli, the Moroccan bandit, had in his possession a Correggio, which was also obtained. Pat;s reputation as a connoisseur in high art was made.",BLNK

It was not until late Tuesday evening that the guard announced the picture had been stolen. After a hasty search, heavy frame was found under a stairway leading to one of the cloakrooms. A scaffold against the facade of the Louvre, placed there in connection with the installation of an elevator, made it easy to enter or leave the building. A persom acquainted with the interior and provided with keys to the various rooms could easily reach the Salon Carre where the picture hung. Some say the portrait was stolen as an object lesson, to show how careless the keepers of the Louvre were and how easily pictures could be stolen. Others think perhaps an artist has stolen it and will return a reproduction and keep the original, or that a big reward will be demanded and its payment the picture will be returned in an indirect way after the excitement has dies down. More romantic than any of these conjectures is that ""Mona Lisa"" is another Helen of Troy. Some one has fallen in love with her and in desperation carried her off to his secret altar from the stare of the croeds and jealousy guard her from the eyes of other worshipers. Where ""Mona Lisa"" is hidden, she is carefully guarded, for no trace has been found; and Paris, as well as thousands of sightseers who have gazed upon her beauty, are still wondering and talking of her dissappearance.","August 21, 1911: Reports from Paris, France that the “Mona Lisa,” painted by the famous Leonardo da Vinci was stolen from the Louvre."

Since the dissappearance of that masterpiece the devotional visits and letters to ""La Belle Ferronnieere"" have doubled in numbers, and the actions of some of the visitors and letter writers have been so fanatical that the painting has been placed under a competent guard night a day. It is also guarded against a too close approach by nay but its official custodians. When Leonardo da Vincii painted Lucrezia he was still a ""primitive."" He had not yet discovered the effect of light and atmonsphere When he painted the poetess he was a pagan-when he produced ""Mona Lisa"" he was a mystic. Not less marvellous either in conception or execution is the portrait of Lucrezia than that of her better known sister. It is more subtle more difficult to understand, that is all. In all the world there does not exist more than a baker's dozen of absolutely authentic paintings by Leonardo. He produced but one great work of sculpture, a esquestrain statue that stood before the feudal castle of his princely, but illigigtimate ancestors, the Sforzesco family of Milan. During the wars that swept over Europe between Charles the Fifth, Henry the Eigth and Francis the First, from which northern Itlay suffered so much and when so many princely treasures were destroyed, this historic monument and the majority of da Vinci's paintings dissappeared. Since the recent dissapearance of the ""Mona Lisa"" a most rigid surveillance is kept over this other great portrait. Already the fickle public is fast losing interest over the lost ""Mona Lisa"" and the beautiful poetess who held the younger Leonardo under her magic sway is to replace the sphinx-like ""La Joconde."" Instead if the unfathomable smile, one ponders over the tempting bow-mouth, the finely chiselled lips with a sensitive turn at the corners; instead of those glistening with humor, sometimes cruel and snake-like, ever enigmatical, ine revels in the depths of those glorious eyes that Leonardo has preserved for us those great intresting eyes of the Lombard poetess whose inner mind is so revealed in the face yet who seems to ask the question that ""Mona Lisa"" knew and defied the world to answer. It was the Salle Carre(Square Hall) of the Louvre that contained ""Mona Lisa,"" as ther the light is most favorable. That the equally beautiful ""La Belle Ferronniere"" has been kept in the semi-seclusion of the long, narrow gallery, however has not hidden it from Leonardo enthusiasts, and now the general public has discovered the sister painting, thronging the less favired gallery and adding to the perplexities of the custodians.",October 1913: Authorities at the Louvre are taking heavier precautious to safeguard other famous works.

PARIS, Dec. 12—The sensation caused by the recovery of 'Mona Lisa' was only equaled by that caused by its disappearance in August, 1911. Special editions of the newspapers carried the news the length and breadth of Paris, and tonight it was the sole topic of conversation. The finding of 'Mona Lisa' had been so often announced, only to be contradicted, that the news was at first received with skepticism. However, Ambassador Barrère's dispatch from Rome to the French minister of public instruction, though brief, was explicit, and the names of the eminent Italian experts mentioned seemed a sufficient guarantee that it was the original painting. Henry Marcel, director general of the French National Museum, for a moment was inclined to doubt the news, saying: 'We have so often been cruelly hoaxed that it is only natural that we should feel skeptical that the painting has been found. The telegram which I have read seems so clear and shows such detailed knowledge, however, that it seems to me the news must be true this time. In any case, the theft undoubtedly was the act of a madman. The motive—to avenge thefts committed in Italy by Napoleon—clearly shows this. 'If the experts' examination proves the picture to be authentic, we will restore it to its familiar place and guard it so that theft will be impossible.' The Florentine dealer, Geri, it is believed, will be entitled to claim rewards amounting to 240,000 francs ($48,000) offered by the Society of Friends of the Louvre and Paris newspapers. M. J. T. Homolle, who was director of the Louvre when 'Mona Lisa' was stolen and who was suspended by the French cabinet because of the loss of the painting, was overcome with joy when he learned of its recovery. Seymour de Ricci, an eminent art critic of Paris, declared his faith in the certification of Dr. Corrado Ricci at Florence of the authenticity of the 'Mona Lisa.' 'I do not think there is the slightest doubt,' he said, 'that the painting will be immediately restored to France.

Paris, February 8. The French Government is determined that 'Mona Lisa' shall not be stolen again. Extraordinary precautions have now been taken to prevent this or any other of the treasures of the Louvre from being taken away. One of the first steps taken to safeguard the Louvre was to employ a number of dogs of the clever breed known as police dogs. One of them guards every fifty feet of wall space day and night. No man can now put a hand over the railing in front of the pictures without having a dog after him. The next protective measure was to connect the pictures by a rod so that all those along a certain wall space can be locked up from one lock. Formerly, every picture hung separately. Under the new arrangement, each line of pictures hangs upon one flat rod by hooks in the frame, which only admit the rod when it is turned edgewise to the opening in the hook. Then the rod is turned so that the picture cannot be removed from it and is locked in that position. Little chambers have also been constructed behind the carved moldings near the ceiling, from which the guardians of the Louvre can secretly watch every person in the rooms. The knowledge that a hidden guardian is watching them is expected to have a terrifying effect on would-be thieves. The pictures have also been connected by electric wiring. Any tampering with them closes a circuit and causes an electric bell to ring loudly. The return of 'Mona Lisa' has only emphasized the necessity of guarding against similar occurrences in the future. The confession of Vincenzo Perugia has revealed the astonishing ease with which he was able to walk away with what is probably the most valuable art treasure in the world. It was on the morning of August 22, 1911, that the world was startled by the announcement that Leonardo da Vinci's great masterpiece had been stolen. Its disappearance from its accustomed place in the Salon Carré, or Square Salon, was noted on August 21. To some reporters who inquired intelligently about its disappearance, the officials on that day explained that it had been taken down to be cleaned. On the following day, the government decided that it was useless to attempt to conceal any longer the fact that it had been stolen. Its value was estimated at $5,000,000. It is interesting to recall some of the extraordinary speculations and theories that were advanced concerning its disappearance. Some argued that it was incredible that a government possession of such incalculable value could be taken by a common thief. They said that some person of great influence, a Cabinet Minister or other high official, had taken the picture to photograph it, had damaged it accidentally, and was keeping it until he could repair it. Another theory was that the mysterious psychological and sex influence of the picture would prove to be the clue to its disappearance. It is well known that this exquisite and subtly fascinating portrait of Mona Lisa del Giocondo exerts a very diverse influence upon the two sexes. Men of impressionable temperament are strongly drawn toward it and feel a deep and even passionate pleasure in the radiations of its 'enigmatical smile.' Women, on the other hand, are, with equal frequency, repelled by it, and are even stirred to hate and fury by the same smile. The partisans of this theory fell into two groups. One group said that a man mentally disordered by the strange fascination of the picture must have stolen it to enjoy its subtle charms in secret. The other group argued that a woman had taken it to vent the rage of her sex upon it. One thing became clear from the mass of theories and interesting facts brought out by the episode. The contents of the Louvre were not, and never had been, well safeguarded. Pictures worth from $1,000,000 to $5,000,000 could have been pulled off their hooks at a favorable moment any day without detection. Officials, moreover, had been in the habit of lending the art treasures to artists and persons of influence. It was stated that 250 pictures had been stolen or 'borrowed' in the course of the nineteenth century. Gradually the months wore on and The recovery of the great picture came to be regarded as hopeless. Then, on December 12, 1913, came the news that it had been found. An art dealer informed the director of the Uffizi Gallery at Florence that an Italian workman named Vincenzo Perugia had taken the picture and had it in Florence. This statement was verified and the 'Mona Lisa' returned to France. The confession of Perugia shows that the subtle psychological influence of this picture had, indeed, much to do with his act. Perugia said: 'I am a patriotic Italian. I saw that the Louvre was filled with masterpieces stolen by Napoleon from Italy. I longed to take something back. 'I thought of taking a Raphael, a Titian, a Correggio, and several other masterpieces. But the Mona Lisa seemed to me much more appealing. 'Here she is. I give her back to my country. It is the greatest sacrifice of my life.' From Perugia’s confession, it appeared that he had worked as a painter for a decorating contractor of 280 Rue St. Honoré, Paris. He had worked as a painter on the Louvre for some weeks but gave up this work on January 24, 1911. Between this date and August 21, he meditated upon and carried out his plan for stealing the Mona Lisa. It was 7 o'clock in the morning of August 21 when he entered the Louvre. The building was open then for the workmen and guardians or caretakers, but the general public was not admitted that day. Perugia wore the long blouse commonly used by French workingmen, especially by house painters. He looked, of course, like a man working on the building. He walked straight up to the picture in the deserted Salon Carré and took it from the hooks by which it was hung. A man standing on the floor could reach his hand to the top of the small picture. Then he realized that the frame would be heavy and hard to conceal. He quickly removed the picture from the frame. He left the picture lying in the salon and carried the frame to a doorway a few yards away at the head of a small stairway and left it outside the door. Then he returned for the picture. He thrust it under his loose blouse, where it was scarcely noticeable. Hearing footsteps, he decided to leave hurriedly by the small stairway where he had left the frame. As he went out, he put the key in his pocket to prevent anyone from pursuing him that way. Having reached the ground, he crossed the Courtyard of the Sphinx, and then passed out through the gateway known as the Porte Visconti, which faces on the Seine. The French authorities summoned Perugia, together with all the workmen who had worked on the Louvre at the time of or just before the theft. He proved that he had not worked there since January 24, and this seemed sufficient explanation. No one discovered that he was the thief until he revealed it himself.",No timeline found

It recalls the most famous of all art thefts—the stealing of the Mona Lisa by an Italian to avenge the depredations of Napoleon a century old. The complete story of that famous mystery only now may be told with authority. Smiling the same inscrutable smile which the master genius, Leonardo da Vinci, imprisoned upon canvas 400 years ago to the vexation of generations of interpreters, Mona Lisa, mysterious portrait, restored to her admirers after strangely vanishing under the eyes of her guards and eluding the frantic search of a nation of art lovers, again looks down from her place in the Louvre, Paris, the interest of her subtle, mystic expression enhanced by reason of her peculiar adventure. Mona Lisa, or, as the Italians call her, La Gioconda, on account of the haunting challenge which the artist divined in the face of his sitter and which he wove into the fabric of his colors, has enthralled and fascinated beholders from the beginning. Many explanatory pages have been written on the meaning of this famous painting, and, provoked by its indefinable charm, its elusive suggestion, many an art student has brought the full power of his critical acumen to the task of finding suitable words for the description of the picture’s strange appeal. Each attempt has failed, and each writer has dwelt with peculiar emphasis upon the qualities of the Mona Lisa smile. This masterpiece is one of the most treasured of the Louvre collection. It has been tentatively valued at more than a million dollars. Painting One of the Most Treasured. It was begun by da Vinci about 1503, when the master stood at the zenith of his fame and power, and, according to Vasari, it took four years of intermittent labor to complete. The woman in whose likeness there was, or into which the artist wrought an intangible something, compelling, unrestful, questioning, in the mind of each who stared back at it, lived in Florence. She was Mona Lisa di Antonio Maria di Noldo Gherardini, a native of Naples, who was married in 1495 to Francesco di Bartolomeo di Zanobi del Giocondo, a prominent citizen of Florence. When she began her sittings for what has since become one of the most renowned of all the world’s portraits, she was probably twenty-five or younger. Da Vinci, painter, poet, engineer, philosopher, and mystic, was fifty-one. Was it an unusual woman that the ripened master painted or was it a forceful symbol coined by his rich, discerning mind? Many times this question has been put to the lady of the superior smile, answered only by the tantalizing glance through the thick, protecting varnish. No wonder, when the loss of their treasure was discovered on the morning of August 21, 1911, a Monday, all Paris was wrought to a frenzy. The news of the theft was received in all parts of the civilized world with the same feelings of dismay. The picture missing from its place in the Salon Carré was the most beautiful from Leonardo’s brush and one of the most precious creations of Western culture. Two Years Pass Without a Clue. Two years and four months passed by without a trace of the vanished work. All efforts of the French police remained fruitless. High rewards offered for the return of the painting went unclaimed, and every clue as to the Whereabouts of the thief ended just without the Louvre gates. As the months sped by while the endeavors of the police proved vain and not even rumors came of a Mona Lisa in foreign lands, all hope that the picture would ever be recovered was given up. It was concluded that the work had been destroyed. The fate of Mona Lisa was put to the account of one of those unintelligible acts of vandalism which go to swell the records of human pathology. Boundless was the enthusiasm, then, which greeted the sudden, unexpected reappearance of the Gioconda Thursday, December 11, 1913, at Florence. In Florence, the original Mona Lisa had sat for a portrait by one of the greatest painters of all time, and in a dingy inn at Florence, the lost painting was found again. The Italian authorities obtained immediate possession of the picture, which was taken in triumphal procession through Italy, under police guard to Rome, to the French ambassador Barrère, and then to Milan, where the director-general of the Louvre, Henry Marcel, and the director of paintings, M. Léprieur, came to take charge of it. The Mona Lisa was again safely housed in Paris last New Year’s Day, and was again hung in its accustomed place at the Louvre, which place had been filled during the time of its loss by Raphael's Castiglione. The theft of this irreplaceable work was an extraordinary one, in that the criminal had been able to penetrate one of the best-guarded treasure houses of Europe and make away with one of its most prized and precious possessions, and disappear with his loot without leaving a single trace behind. The thief was an unusual one, in that for two years and four months he kept his secret, the priceless Mona Lisa hidden away in his garret bedroom in Paris, only in the end to fall into the hands of the criminal authorities through an act of childish carelessness, an almost imbecile simplicity. Immediately, after the discovery of the theft, it was thought in Paris that the thief had hidden himself away in the gallery Saturday afternoon, remained in the place all night, and escaped with his spoil Monday morning. The glass casing and the frame of the picture were found leaning against the wall of a narrow stairway leading from the gallery des sept metres, where the old Italian pictures are hung, to the Court of the Sphinx. The door opening from the stairway, part of glass protected by ironwork, was locked, and, at the investigation, Sauvet, one of the workingmen in the Louvre, remembered having opened the door at the request of a person upon whom he came sitting at the bottom of the stairway. He failed to take further notice of this person, other than that he was wearing a blouse similar to those worn by the regular guards. As Monday is cleaning day, and visitors are barred, no suspicion crossed his mind but that the man was what he seemed—an official. Here the trail ended. A print of a left thumb upon the abandoned glass frame was all that remained in the way of a clue to the police. Notwithstanding full reports of the matter in L'Illustration, and other papers, nothing more of the criminal was learned. L'Illustration immediately announced that it would pay 40,000 francs, about $8,000, to anyone who would return the picture by September 26, and 45,000 francs—or $9,000—if the picture was brought to them by September 1. It was further announced that no questions would be asked. The editors received some five hundred letters in answer to their announcements, investigated some one hundred cases, and learned nothing. The Museum Club (Amis du Louvre) gave the police 25,000 francs to be used for the obtaining of the painting. The court of investigation convened August 22, and in its hearings the photographed thumb print played a leading role. No less than 257 persons were ordered by the court to submit their thumb prints for comparison. Among those furnishing such prints were the directors of the Louvre. The theif of course was not upin the list of those investigated. Vincenzo Peruggia, an Italian, the real despoiler, as established by his own confession and the exact agreement of the fingerprint found upon the glass case with that of his own thumb, when taken into custody by the Italian police, cleared up the murky mystery. He maintained that he entered the Louvre, together with other workmen, Monday morning, made his way unobserved to the Mona Lisa, removed it from its hanging, carried it to the stairway where the frames were found, cut the painting loose from its casing, concealed it in his blouse, and persuaded a passing workman to open the door for him without so much as seeing a guard around. Once outside the Louvre, he proceeded to his lodging house, a nest for a colony of Italian workmen, where he hid the picture and went on with his regular work—that of a house painter and glazier. He continued to ply his trade for more than two years, a thing worth to him a tremendous fortune concealed in the false bottom of his wooden trunk, before trying to dispose of it. Only once was the suspicion of the police directed upon him. But how he escaped that once is another mystery. Peruggia had been employed at the Louvre as a glazier and had been entrusted with the work of framing some of the most costly masterpieces. In October 1911, Prof. Pierre Marcel of the École des Beaux-Arts wrote an open letter to the paper Figaro, suggesting that trace of the criminal was to be sought among the Louvre glaziers. The director of painting took the suggestion, obtained the names of those so employed and formerly so employed, upon which list appeared the name of Peruggia, who, with the rest, was subject to an examination and a house search. The mystery is that the police did not take the fingerprints of these men for comparison, as had been done at the first investigation. Peruggia's downfall came with his attempt to dispose of his spoil. He wrote on November 28, 1913, to Alfred Geri, owner of the Galleria d'Arte e Moderna, at Florence, a dealer in art works, offering, under the name of Leonardi, to sell him the Mona Lisa, which he explained, as a patriotic Italian, he felt ought to be returned to Italy, the land of its production. This plea, strengthened to one of patriotic bitterness that rich Paris should not be decorated with the spoils of Italy robbed during the times of Napoleon, he maintained after his arrest. Geri sought counsel from Prof. Giovanni Poggi, director of the Florence galleries. As a result of his conference, he answered the letter from Paris, entering heartily into the writer's proposals and sentiment, finally arranging a meeting in Italy, which took place at Florence on December 11, when the lost Mona Lisa was drawn from her hiding place under the false trunk bottom and returned to the world after her long seclusion. Nor has the Mona Lisa's smile lost aught of its subtlety.",No timeline found

Florence, Italy, June 4.—The trial of Vincenzo Perugia, on the charge of stealing Da Vinci's masterpiece, ""Mona Lisa"" from the Louvre in Paris, began here today. The disappearance of the picture on August 22, 1911, caused a sensation throughout the world, and search for it was not successful until December 12, 1913, when Perugia offered it for sale to a Florentine antiquarian. D. R. Analdi, an alienist, said at today’s hearing that Perugia was only partially responsible for his actions. Perugia did not deny that he had taken ""Mona Lisa"" from the Louvre. He said it was his desire to have it placed in the Palazza Degli Uffizi in Florence. Testimony as to the authenticity of the picture was given by several experts. Other witnesses gave evidence as to the details of the theft.","June 5, 1914: The court in Florence, Italy gave Vincenzo Perugia a “very light sentence,” which was one year and fifteen days."

Salomon Reinach, a French Searcher for the Truth, Tells of His Efforts to Learn the Facts of Remarkable Portrait. Paris.—The unprecedented enthusiasm over the return of the Mona Lisa to Paris takes us back to the days of her first arrival, 400 years and more ago. Vincenzo Perugia, the Italian artisan, who abducted her from the Louvre in 1911 to ""give her back"" to Florence, is completely mistaken in his facts. Mona Lisa was always a Paris resident. At the moment when Perugia imagines her to have been ""stolen"" from Italy ""by Napoleon,"" she had not been living in Italy for 300 years. Mona Lisa was brought to Paris by her father, Leonardo da Vinci, who sold her to King Francis I for $40,000 of our money—a terrific price in those days. When first exhibited in the palace of the Louvre 400 years ago there was a rush of all the notables of Paris to see her, comparable only to the present ovation of her return. Leonardo was the star guest of the French king, more run after and admired in Paris than in his native Italian city; and he could sell every scrap of his works. In his baggage when he came to France he brought the Mona Lisa. ""Why does she smile so sadly?"" asked the French king. Leonardo never told him. Yet he knew why. Why does Mona Lisa smile so sadly? Here at last is her true pathetic history. Now is the time to tell it. Mona Lisa has too long been misunderstood. ""During 400 years past,"" says Paul Leprieur, curator of the Louvre paintings, who went to Italy and brought her back, ""during 400 years past Mona Lisa has addled the wits of those who have talked about her after having looked too long upon her.”“Four centuries is rather much,” replies Salomon Reinach. This Salomon Reinach is the very type of the exact archaeologist. He will not permit geniuses to create facts, and is the enemy of wind and flapdoodle, breaking in on lofty theories with a marriage or death certificate. He is curator of the St. Germain museum, a remarkably distinguished man, perfectly well known in America. And Salomon Reinach pricked the bubble of all this wind about Mona Lisa. Leonardo da Vinci took four years (1501–1504) to paint the wife of his friend, Francesco del Giocondo; and, so far from being in love with her or she with him, he dropped both portrait and sitter again and again, on a moment’s notice, to go on pleasure or business trips. Reinach is a terrible man. He chases a date through a hundred manuscripts until he traces it. Leonardo quit Florence in 1499, to return only in 1501. In 1502 he traveled in Umbria as architect of Valentine Borgia. He returned to Florence in 1503, went on a pleasure jaunt to Venice in 1505, returned, and went to Milan in 1506. That is not four years of loving contemplation, is it? The truth is, that Leonardo painted the portrait gratis for his friend, the husband dropping in when business called. It bears every mark of such a non-paid, purely friendship portrait—to the last, in which the painter sells it to a third party. Salomon Reinach has found it. We know the melancholy of Mona Lisa. Married in 1496, she had no children until 1499. Then came a little daughter. Salomon Reinach remembered that once a librarian of Florence communicated to Muntz, the great French art historian, an extract from the ancient Libre del Morti—records of deaths in Florence. By this, it appears that on June 1, 1501, the little daughter (fanciulla) of Francesco del Giocondo and his wife Mona Lisa was buried from the church of Santa Maria Novella. Why, the very costume of Mona Lisa in the picture is heavy mourning! You see now. Her smile is a constrained smile, the best she can do to please the kindly painter who has paid singers, musicians, and buffoons to entertain her.",No timeline found

Later tho day 111 HHHHHmBHSW' became known as tho festival of Hll arla and was hold on the Ides of March. As was tho custom of tho day, offerings wore made at tho tem ple."" With tho advent of Christianity the festival was changed, and although It still Included many pagan customs, It becamo a celebration"" In honor of Mother Church and was held on Mid Lent Sunday, or tho fourth Sunday In Lent On this day tho faithful came to bring offerings to Mother Church. Finally, tho day took tho name of Mothering Sunday, and was sot aside as-tho time when peoplo should pay visits to their paronts, especially to tholr mothers, also that they should carry with them some cako or trinket. ""Going a-mothcrlng"" soon becamo tho fashion and a certain kind of cako known as simncl cako was carried as a gift to tho mothor. Horrick, tho poet, In addressing one of tho char actors of his poem on Mothering, says: ""I'll to thee a slmnel bring Gainst thou go a-mothering, So that when sho blessos theo, Half that blessing thou'lt give me."" This proves that even In tho early days tho mothers' blosslng was highly regarded. In England tho slmnel cake3 woro composed of a crust made of flno flour and water with sufficient saffron to give it a deop yellow color and the interior filled with such ingredients as Is used In plum puddings. They aro boiled and brushed over with egg and set away to harden. When they are to bo used they must bo robaked and softened. This, custom was In vogue during tho seventeenth century when every child who resided away from homo was expected to carry a slmnel to his or her mothor. Fre quently tho cakes wero kept until Easter -and sorved ns tho desert for the dinner on that day. Early Celebrations Mothers' Day was first observed in 1908 In Philadelphia by Bevoral of tho Sunday schoolB, and in 1909 about two thousand people took part In tho services. Seattle, Washington, how over, has tho honor of being tho real pioneer In a genuino Mothers' Day celebration. This was In 1900 when hundrods of peoplo gathered in tho churches of that city on tho second Sunday In May. They carried bou quets and wreaths of flowers and at the closo of sermons on ""Mothor Lovo"" tho entire congregations hold tholr flowors aloft whllo tho pastor pronounced a blessing, and at the closo of tho service tho flowers were gathered together and placed on the graves of mothers whoso relatives wero not in tho city to perform this loving service. In 1910 tho Governor of tho State of Washington set asldo tho eighth of May ot that year as Mothers' Day for that Stato, and over slnco that tlmo tho proclamation of Mothers' Day has been issued with tho samo regularity as that of Thanksgiving. A request is also added that each person wear a whlto flower on tho day and that special services should bo held in tho churches. Tho Stato of Oklahoma was the next to fall in lino wltha Mothers' Day proclamation, whon Governor Leo Cruco in 1912 paid such a glowing tribute to motherhood in his procla mation to tho peoplo of that Stato: ""Each citizen, whether old or young, rich or poor, happy or -sorrowful, remember her whoso lovo passeth human understand ing, and remembering, manifest to tho world your lovo nnd gratl tudo by wearing a carnation In honor of tho dearest of all moth ers, and wearing It, think of her and love her."" Slnco that tlmo many Slatos have followed the example of these two. Western States, and at present tho day has takon-'H prdrrfihent plnfo among our feast days. Sermons aro preached on tho subject of motherhood in the majority of our churches. Tho Sun day schools have a Mothors Day ser vice, and In tho afternoon many go out to tho cemotories to cover tho gravo of ""man's best friend"" with gar lands of flowors. Mothers' Pensions Tho celebration of Mothers' Day has brought about a stronger feeling on tho subject of pensioning mothers, and ono Is surprised to learn how many States havo already adopted tho pensioning system for mothors who aro too poor to properly caro for their chlldron. Whllo the plan is too now to show vory many benefits to tho mother and child tho sponsors of tho bill In tho City of Chicago aro of the opinion that a child can bo maintained at homo choaper than It can in an in stitution, and also that a child with a homo is less likely to turn criminal than tho ono brought up in an Insti tution.

Mother Influence on Statesmen Tho significance of Mothers' Day should find an echo in every heart, for It was tho mothors of our Statos- Imen who Jn the early days put our 'Nation on a 'firm foundation ""The hand that rocks the cradlo Is the hand I that rules tho world."" It was tho mother of Georgo Washington who, by hor woman's intuition that ho was mado for better things, saved him from becoming a midshipman on a British ship. It was the turning point in tho life of tho Father of his Country whon rather than causo his mother sorrow ho roturnod his middy uniform and said ""Mothor I can never go and cause you so much grief.

Every man and woman blessed with a good mother knows it's true and knows why it's true. It doesn't take a very old child to understand, either. But, since human nature is human nature, every day isn't observed as Mother's Day. There is all the more reason, therefore, for observing the second Sunday in May May 14, this year with a real celebration. Some one has tried to figure out a real cele bration after this fashion for sons: Wear a flower in mother's honor a white one if mother is dead; a col ored flower for a living mother. Send mother a box of spring flowers. Write her a letter a long one. Give mother a whole day of your time for that ""good visit"" she longs for. Send mother your picture, and snap shots of your home, your children, your work. Tell mother, your plans and ambi tions she made them possible. Tell mother your smaller troubles she wants to help you. Thank mother for her care and her teachings tell her how they have helped you. Don't forget that mother still likes candy. Mother was your first and truest sweetheart don't forget to say ""I love you I"" For the daughters these things are suggested It's your chance to say ""thank you"" to your best friend your mother. Be sure to celebrate by wearing a flower for mother: White for mothers not living; colored flowers for mother still with you. Send mother some gay spring flow ers, a brilliant bouquet or a thrifty plant. Make a dainty cap or a ""dress-up"" gown or shirtwaist as a love gift to mother. If mother is far away, send her a ""special delivery letter"" for her Sun day treat. Send mother the book you just en Joyed reading. Don't forget to send her pictures of yourself, your friends and your good times. Tell mother your small joys and sor rows and ask her advice It will be good. Ask mother to tell you about her girlhood you'll both enjoy it. Mother is a gin too. She likes pretty things, love, laughter and compliments. Give her some. The spirit of this celebration is right enough. The letter of it fails. Nobody can tell you how to observe Mother's Day.. You know. If she's a red carnation mother make her happy. If she's a white carnation mother, do something that would make her happy if she were a red carnation mother. Nobody can draw up a celebration schedule for Mother's Day. How can one, when nobody can find adequate words to write about Mother's Day? Mother's Day is something new In the way of holidays not like Christ mas and Easter which are old, old holidays. And It's new, compared with the Fourth of July. In fact, It's just about the newest holiday we have. It was no longer ago than 1906 that Miss Anne Jarvis of Philadelphia, hon oring the memory of her own mother on the anniversary of her death, con ceived of a day of which everyone should do reverence to his mother, whether living or dead. The World's Sunday School association adopted the plan, and, in the next few years, an nually designated one Sunday as Mother's Day. The purposes of this celebration, as stated by Dr. George W. Bailey, then president of the asso ciation, were: ""To recall the memories of the mothers that are gone, and through loving words and loving care to brighten the lives of the mothers that remain, and to help children, men and women to a greater blessing in honor ing their fathers and their mothers. ""To recall mother's prayers, moth er's dying words, and the promises made to mother by the big boy that still mourns her, and to stop and think a little of what she was in her life to her family."" In 1908 Miss Jarvis founded an or ganization now known as Mother's Day International association. The idea was taken up by the states. In 1910 the governor of Washington Issued a proclamation designating May 8 of that year as ""Mother's Day"" and urged It be celebrated by special services and the wearing of a white flower in honor of all mothers. In 1912 the governor of Oklahoma issued a similar proclamation. National recognition was given Mother's Day by resolution of the Sixty-third congress, approved by the President of the United States on May 8, 1914, designating that the second Sunday in May thereafter should gen erally be known as ""Mother's Day,"" and directing that it should be the duty, of the President to request its ob servance by Issuing a proclamation calling upon the government officials to display the United States flag on all government buildings, and the peo ple to display the flag at their homes or other suitable places on this day, ""as a public expression of our love and reverence for the mothers of our country."" Originally the white carnation was the flower worn in observance of the day. Then, the public settled on white carnations for mothers dead and ted carnations for mothers living; then on white flowers and colored flowers. Now the tendency is to wear ""mother's favorite flower."" The great of the world have been proud to pay tribute to mothers. Unhappy is the man for whom his own mother has not made all other mothers venerable. Rlchter. A man never sees all that his mother has been to him till it's too late to let her know that he sees it. W. D. Howells. If you would reform the world from its errors and vices, begin by enlisting the mothers. C. Simmons. I think It must somewhere be writ ten that the virtues of the mothers shall be visited on their children, as well as the sins of the fathers. Charles Dickens. The loving sacrifices of motherhood must burn on the altar of undying faith. If I could bequeath but one priceless heritage to youth, it would be the ability to know the full measure of her love. Her Influence is the most changeless thing in the fiber of a man's character. It outweighs arts, science, literature and philosophy, for her faith and works are better than all the wise man's knowledge. Sena tor Lawrence T. Sherman.

Like all things on earth it was forty years in the wilderness. It first made its appearance in Paris and received notice of the following effect in the Courier de Paris. The date of the extract was July 25, 1789: “It was stated that a certain vehicle, invented by M. M. Blanchard and Massaurier—the former the celebrated aeronaut—was exhibited in rapid motion in the Place Louis XII. on July 27, 1789, in presence of many members of the French academy and a large concourse of spectators. At the front of the machine was the head of an eagle with outspread wings, to which was attached the apparatus with which the driver directed its movements. Behind him was seated an individual who gave an impetus, more or less rapid, to the machine by pressing his feet alternately on the ground. He sat down or stood at discretion, with his legs half concealed in a sort of box, where the springs that communicated movement to the machine were evidently placed. The vehicle was subsequently transported to Versailles, and exhibited its capabilities in presence of Louis XVI, Maria Antoinette and their court. There is nothing to show why this experiment failed, but it is to be supposed that it had its defects.” The second appearance was also in 1808, and public exhibitions were made of its workings in the Jardin du Luxembourg, but without success. At that time it was mounted on very low wheels, and the rider had to support himself by placing his feet directly on the ground. Such a mechanism was of course rudimentary, and the result was that the invention was extensively ridiculed and caricatured, and in these archives only do any traces of the first experiments made with this machine in the garden of Luxembourg exist. But the modern railroad locomotive was also sneered at and caricatured, and so was the modern steamboat. And the early inventors, who sought to make the world wiser, were called disciples of the black art, and friends of the devil. And more, they were socially ostracized; they were hooted at and stoned by the mob, and sometimes burned at the stake. But they never ceased scheming and planning, nor was the velocipede to stop here. Twenty years after its first exhibition the velocipede reappeared in Paris. This time, a public functionary, one M. Dreuze, perfected the machine of twenty years before, and again exhibited it in its improved form. M. Dreuze secured the rider’s point of support upon the axletrees to the two wheels instead of the ground, and thus created the actual modern velocipede. The inventor, who belonged to the administration of postoffices, also formed the further idea of proposing this machine for the use of rural postmen, as being of greater availability in the matter of speed and promptness, and at the same time causing them less The plan was adopted, but unfortunately, just in the winter season, when many difficulties existed in the way of locomotion. The wheels slipped about in the mud, and plans were frustrated, and the enterprise was again considered a failure. At this late date, it would have been suggested that it was only necessary to iron the wheels or suspend the use of the velocipede during the winter; but the French Government lacks invention and dropped the velocipede. “Three times and out,” is the old saying, but not so with our subject. A few years on, and, undiscouraged, the velocipede appeared a third time, and again in an altered form—this time being a little carriage upon three wheels and propelled by the hands of the rider. This machine did not succeed on account of the difficulty in guiding it and the fatigue it caused the guider. It is a well-known fact that the muscles of the legs can be used much longer than those of the arms, and, acting upon this hint, all good velocipedes are so arranged that the action of the arms is merely complimentary to that of the legs. This failure was the result of not attending to this fact. “The mills of the gods grind slowly, but they grind exceedingly fine.” Science and improvement move like the tortoise, but still, they move, as Galileo said of the world. When a pebble is dropped in the water your eye loses the ripple. But that little splash has displaced every drop in the stream, and the water you see before you has been completely changed. The velocipede as it has been exhibited thus far was an idea dropped into the mud, and that idea must grow, and the mind must be revolutionized before its work ends. In the presence of success who is so bold as to laugh. Ridicule falls harmless before the iron armor of prosperity. And the velocipede succeeded. Paris, where it was hooted at and frowned down, now lifts up the prostrate work, and the thing despised yesterday is the idol worshipped to-day. It is the poetry of justice, and the two share the triumph. The thoroughfares of Paris are thronged with countless riders on the strange creature, and the public have warned the velocipede votaries that they must carry their lanterns on their vehicles to avoid accidents. The mania has spread to all classes, and to the suburban cities of the capital. In St. Cloud, Vincennes, Engheim, Pantim; in Bordeaux, Marseilles, and the other principal cities, the people are all riding this economical species of iron horse, which requires no feed, harness, stable, or groom to care for it. The velocipede and velocipede mania has reached America. It struck New Orleans many years ago. But the inhabitants of that benighted burg thought it might be the ""yellow jack"" in disguise, and gave it the cold shoulder. Time passed, and all Europe was ablaze with enthusiasm and astride of their favorite Philadelphia, stand and quakerish, has adopted the velocipede with but little less enthusiasm than New York. Jersey is practicing, and so are the swells and the broadcloth fractions of the rectangular city bid fair to rival New York in their exhibition of the new order of equestrianism. Chicago, as in all things, rides velocipedes are becoming a matter of every day occurrence on our streets. Our tradesmen and mechanics are beginning to lay them in for sale. The fever is catching, by the time the season opens we will see them coming among our regular institutions. If they are to prove a success, there is no city and surrounding country better adapted for them than this is; a city perfectly flat, and a surrounding country equally flat, are elements for the use of this machine best calculated to test its merits. Chicago, as is her wont, is not to be beaten even in velocipedes, and comes to the rescue with a machine which differs from any other extant, not only in its general appearance, but in its motive power. This Chicago velocipede has three wheels, two behind and one in front. The hind wheels are considerably the largest, being four feet and two inches in diameter, while the front wheel is only two feet and one-half. The front wheel is for the purpose of guiding the machine, and is connected by a lever with the body, and reaching within convenient distance of the seat, a straddle runs up from the axle of the front or guiding wheel, about a foot from the tire, which surmounted by a lamp. This velocipede is propelled by spring-power, which works as follows: On the axle of the hind wheels is fastened a pinion, which is operated upon by a cog wheel, five times its size in diameter. Fastened to each side of this large cog-wheel is a dog, which works into a ratchet, upon the hub of which ratchet is fastened the center of the springs. The other end of the spring is fastened to a rod of iron, which runs through the body of the velocipede. These springs are made of the very best English spring steel, two inches wide, one-tenth of an inch thick, and nine feet long, and when wound up their power is estimated at over 3,000 pounds each. Immediately outside of the spring, and in the ratchet hub, is fastened one of the treadles. The large cog-wheel and ratchet work loose around the shaft on which they are placed. The treadles are two feet long, and reach from the ratchet shaft to within convenient distance for the foot of a person occupying the seat. On the end of each treadle is a slipper to keep the foot from being shoved forward. By an ingenious contrivance the wheels can be thrown out of gear, so that the velocipede, even under full headway, can be turned around within a space of fourteen feet. The seat has the appearance and general characteristics of a buggy seat, and can carry two persons with ease. It was designed for the use of ladies only, but can be used by anybody. The grand feature of this Chicago velocipede is, that it is worked by spring power, and that the springs can be perpetually wound up by simply using the treadles after ately. It only takes one-fourth the power to wind the springs that the springs exert in unwinding. By pressing upon the treadle with the foot the ratchet is turned, on which is placed the spring, which of course is thereby wound. It differs from the Alton invention in this, that the springs are being continuously wound by the alternate treadles, and this can always be kept in motion; while the Alton invention runs only a mile and then stops to be wound again. This Chicago invention has been tested and all who have seen it are sanguine of its success. The cost of one of these machines will be about $100. Velocipedes are of various kinds. Some have two, and others three, and even four wheels; all have either pedals or rests on which to place the feet, and usually either brakes or levers to regulate the speed.THE TWO-WHEEL VELOCIPEDES. The two wheeled velocipedes, or the bicycles as they are styled, are intended for the male sex only, and are by far the swiftest machines. They are usually of wrought iron, and have pedals or reels attached to the front and large wheel, and the working of these gives a light movement of the feet and the requisite impulse to the vehicle. The saddle is placed upon a bar of iron, suspended four inches above the top of the fore wheel. The hands rest on a handle in front of the machine, which, working on a pivot, serves as a balancing pole, and equilibrium is preserved by exercising a slight twist to this handle. By this means the rider stops the revolving motion of THE THREE-WHEEL VELOCIPEDES. The three-wheel velocipede, or tricycle, is easier to guide and safer to use than the bicycle. Its speed, however, is less rapid; still, it can be made to pass a carriage at full trot. As the fair sex largely patronize the tricycle, the seat is more commodious than that of the bicycle, having sides and backs of wicker, and a horse hair cushion to sit upon. The hind wheels, though large, are light, and revolve with facility. The fore wheel, which is smaller, serves to guide the machine, being acted upon by means of the handle, which causes it instantly to turn in the direction indicated by the rider. The pedals are shaped like slippers, which facilitate the movement of the legs, and at the same time admit of the foot being disengaged instantaneously. The movement required to impel the machine is a perfectly natural one, analogous to that of walking. That is, it requires but the slightest pressure of the foot, and produces no unusual fatigue to the leg. In addition to these advantages, the largest three-wheeled velocipedes have carriers attached to the pedals and fit on the axles. By this means the speed of the vehicle is considerably increased, and the pressure of the foot is relieved by transmitting the motion to the driving apparatus of the machine by means of impulse and a brake.","1869: An article reviews the history of the “velocipede” (self-propelled, wheeled vehicles)."

The speedy little two-wheelers have been tuned up to the second and will be out today to cut down existing records, and judging from the time made yesterday the fastest miles ever seen on a local track will result. All of the events are well filled and much interest is being shown in the races. The following is the program of events: Race No. 1—Five miles, fully equipped stock machines, single cylinder, under 50 cu. in. Prize, $30, $15, $5 in merchandise. Race No. 2—Five miles, fully equipped stock machines, twin cylinder, under 60 cu. in. Prize, $30, $15, $5 in merchandise. Race No. 3—Five miles, Club challenge cup for single cylinders, for club members only owning machines 15 days old. Race No. 4—Five miles, Club challenge cup for multiple cylinders, for club members only owning machines 15 days old. Race No. 5—Man against motorcycle, 100 yards. Prize, $5 in merchandise.

Race No. 14—One hour race, free for all. Prize, beautiful cup. The track was alive with speeding machines yesterday and the trials went off without an accident of any kind. A force of police kept the people off the course to prevent a repetition of the unfortunate occurrence of the day previous. The fastest work yesterday was done by Paul Derkum on a “Thor.” He went close to 56 seconds for the mile, and says he will reach that mark in the contest today. Ben Brees did some fast riding on an Indian. He went around the circle in 58 seconds. Others who went close to the minute mark were John Derkum, W. Hose and G. Blaylock, these latter on single cylinder machines. The track is in the best of shape and there is every reason to expect the fastest time. Jake De Rosier, the well-known Indian rider, will not appear. He was talked of on all sides as Derkum’s one opponent to be feared, but he has not been entered, and C.W. Risden, the local Indian agent, says he never expected him to be here for the contests. The statement that De Rosier would race here was unauthorized, according to Risden. Risden said last night that his fastest Indian machine was put out of commission in the tryouts Monday. Brees had gone to the track without sufficient oil, and a piston stuck, putting the car out of the running. There are fifteen entries in the five-mile free-for-all for one-cylinder machines. Four Thors, a Merkel, three Indians, two Reading Standards, two Ives, and H-D's, a Harley Davidson and Peugeot will do battle. All the crack riders are entered to ride, including Derkum, Wilson, Hoag, Knapp, Richardson and Seymour. The one-hour race will be a hummer. Twenty-one are named to go, and the skill of the riders and the stamina of the machines will be thoroughly tested.",No timeline found

If one is to believe the statements of the leading motorcycle manufacturers of the day and their statements seem logical, it is cheaper to make a trip to town on a motorcycle than to drive or walk. A manufacturer of one of these motorcycles (his particular make holds the world's record for economy) states that while the machine that made the world's record traveling fifty miles at a cost of less than one-tenth cent per mile over country roads was operated by an expert, it is nothing unusual for this particular make of motorcycle in the hands of an amateur to travel from six to eight miles on one cent's worth of gasoline. In comparison with the private riding horse the expense per mile is naturally much less and if one figures that while the driving horse must be fed daily, the motorcycle only consumes while in use, the difference is still greater. The limit of a horse for continuous daily driving is probably thirty miles, while that of a motorcycle is over two hundred. Good traveling for a horse means four miles an hour; good traveling for a motorcycle, twenty miles a motorcycle from thirty to fifty miles per hour. In this age of scarce hired help, time, at some season is extremely valuable to the farmer. His ability to cover the distance to town and back with a motorcycle in one fifth of the road driving horse time and with no time wasted harnessing and unharnessing, is a factor to be considered. Most all the good motorcycles are now equipped with tandem attachments and luggage carriers, if desired. By means of this tandem attachment two can ride as well as one. The luggage carrier permits the carrying of small freight, not exceeding 200 pounds. Many a farmer, as well as his children, have rebelled at their inability to go to town, to the swimming hole or the fishing grounds in the late summer evening, for a horse cannot be worked all day and be driven on the road at night. To these the motorcycle fills a long felt want. It is ever ready, costs nothing when idle and will last for years. It is really more expensive to be without a motorcycle than to own one, just as it is more expensive to plow with a hand plow, cradle the grain and use the flail instead of the modern appliances. The best makes of motorcycle today can be had for from $225 up. A motorcycle like many other pieces of machinery, can be built too cheaply to be good. There are, however, several well-established makes, which have years of successful manufacture behind them and one will not go amiss in choosing any of these. The motorcycle of today has come to stay. Already in the cities it is being adopted extensively by business firms because of the great time-saving its use assures. Repair men, inspection men, etc., can accomplish triple the work possible with their former horse and carriage. The saving of time as well as the great pleasure to be derived from its use has given the motorcycle a lasting place in the home of the American farmer.",1910-1915: Motorcycles are gaining acceptance as an economical means to accomplish many tasks.

Preacher, Doctor, Policeman and Soldier Now Use Two-Wheeled Vehicles. Hundreds of daily demonstrations are proof of the utility, speed, and economy of the modern motor cycle. There is scarcely a field of activity that the two-wheeler has not entered and proved its value. The motor cycle carries the minister to reach his patient in less time than ever before, making it possible to eliminate many hours of human suffering. The motor cycle carried the minister of the gospel on his missions of mercy. The motor cycle is a part of every progressive police department, carrying mounted officers to the scene of crime or accident, and enabling them to run down violators of the law. The motor cycle aids the forest ranger in protecting our great timber lands from fire. The motor cycle carries mail and delivers telegrams. The motor cycle rushes the important prescription to the bedside of the suffering. The motor cycle hurries the pulmotor to the beach, where every second counts, in the effort to restore life. A motor cycle mounted guard accompanies the President of the United States in his trips about the capital. Motor Cycle in War. Uses of the motor cycle in the army are almost unlimited. Motor cycle dispatch riders and scouts have won great fame for themselves in the present European struggle. Machine guns mounted on motor cycles are carried to their positions on the battlefield; motor cycles with side-cars hurry supplies to the Red Cross workers who are seeking to relieve the injured soldiers to the hospitals. ""The motor cycle has revolutionized signaling on the battlefield,"" says Henry Beach Needham, a war correspondent. It has practically done away with wig-wagging on the field. It is economical, efficient, and speedy; it is everywhere and nowhere as much as the front. For pleasure too, the motor cycle has made a definite place for itself. The ease with which the two-wheeler is operated, its reliability, and comfort make it an ideal vehicle for touring. Club sociability and endurance runs are enjoyed by thousands of riders all over the country every year. And more and more we hear of the long-distance tourist, riding from ocean to ocean, from gulf to lake, around the United States or circling the globe—for pleasure. Many of these long-distance tourists are women, who find as much pleasure in the sport as do the men. King ""Eight"" Car Arrives. The new 1915 eight-cylinder King touring car arrived last night, and will be placed on exhibition at the local salesroom of William P. Barnhart & Co., 1712 14th street northwest. The car has been on display at the national automobile show, and is making its debut in the National Capital. Awarded First Honors. William P. Barnhart, local distributor for the King in this section, has been awarded first prize in the contest for November and December on the sale of King motor cars. Mr. Barnhart is in receipt of a check for $350 and a gold Swiss watch as the result of the contest. He competed against the branch houses in Chicago, New York, Philadelphia, and Boston.

Throughout most of the years since 1913 Billings has had an active motorcycle club. In those 27 years the city has watched [motorcycling] grow from a fad in which few cared to risk their necks, to the modern streamlined sport it is today, with scores of enthusiasts. Motorcycling has always had its thrills but the modern, high-powered machine goes further and combines all the speedy action of aquaplaning and flying, yet offers the pleasures and comforts of motoring. The city’s first motorcycle club in 1913 was a novel and, if it may be said, a noble experiment. It worked, and about a score of dashing young daredevils went in for motorbiking. Officers of that early club were George Bott, president; August Trutnau, vice president; Clarence H. Lauson, road lieutenant; E. J. Robb, activities chairman; and Martin Curtis, racing chairman. With the horse and buggy era on the wane, young road demons, astraddle explosive two-wheeled gas burners, awed the town with feats of speed and daring. Motorcycling came into its own as one of the most popular sports of the day.Motorcycle racers thrilled thousands at the Midland Empire fair during the years from 1915 to 1920. In 1915 and 1916 races also were staged on a track at Joliet and hundreds of Billings fans traveled there regularly to watch those thrilling contests in which the more daring riders would sometimes hit a breakneck pace of “60 miles per hour.” State Racing Circuit In addition, there was a state motor-cycle racing circuit to coincide with fairs at Bozeman, Great Falls, Helena, Miles City, and Roundup. Several Billings riders competed in these early meets. They included Pat Curtis, Martin Curtis, Bob Robb, George Tur-ner, Frank Boyd, Don Rieger, Fen Garvin, Johnny Thomas, Clar-ence Lauzon, Buck Engelhardt, Grant Lam-port and Fred Olsen. Favorite per-formers on the old Joliet racetrack were the Curtises, Turner, Robb, Nelson Wells and Frank Boyd. ""Those were the good old days,"" it was the motorcyclists who braved the stretches of open road on which no operator of a horseless carriage would dare to tread. They tackled bridges across streams, stretches of deep sand, oozy gumbo and miles of mud to go on where some of the difficulties surrounding even these early circuits sub-dued the timid. The city's first motorcycle club maintained active membership until 1917, when several of its members entered service for the World War. Between 1918 and 1921 there was a lull in activities. The Billings club was reorganized in 1921 and has been a functioning organization since. In the years 1914 to 1917 Ira S. Dille, Harry Williams, Frank Boyd, E. J. Robb, Alec McLeod served as club presi-dents and Robert E. ""Bob"" Cooke was secretary-treasurer. When reorganized in 1921 C. M. Lauzon was elected presi-dent, A. Nicolas, vice president, and Frank Polesek, secretary-treasurer. New Popularity Peak Motorcycling today has hit a new peak in popularity and the Billings club has a large active membership. There are approximately 100 of the two-wheeled machines registered in Yellowstone County. The Billings Motorcycle Club promotes a full active program each summer, highlighted by such events as gypsy tours, reliability runs, and hill climbs. The club has been affiliated with the American Motorcycle Association since 1929. Endurance or reliability runs of the Billings club date back to 1916, when a 126-mile trip was made to Miles City and return. Dirt roads, turned to mud by heavy rains, tortuous hills, and ruts made this endurance test live long in the memories of the riders who participated, including R. E. Cooke, Clarence Lauzon, Pat Curtis, Martin Curtis, E. J. Robb, Johnny Thomas, Frank Hayes, Carl Aurich, Don Rieger, and Fred Olsen. Other riders who took part in events of the early motorcycle club and who still reside in Billings were Dr. C. H. Nelson, C. G. Gans, Jimmie Noyes, Horace Noyes, Bob Freeman, Glenn Farrell, Gus Wanderling, Eddie Eichenhard, Dan Davies, Walter Fultz, Bob Mitchell, and Peter Yeegen Jr. The club today is headed by Charles Lasher, president; Herman Judd, vice president; Andrew Dukes, treasurer; and Fred Olsen, secretary.",No timeline found

The Planchette Craze Has Broken Out Again. UNSEEN FORCES AT WORK. Some Uncanny Pranks of a Little Instrument That Once Held the Attention of the World. There Is a planchette fever in San Fran cisco. Clubs of patient sitters, anxious to hold communion with the dead and distant liv ing, have been formed here and in Oak land. Daily and nightly seances are being held. Plancbette is old, so old that it is almost new again. Early in the fifties the weird little contrivance was invented and ten years later nearly the whole civilized world was teaming with a recital of its wonders. The most uncanny tales were related of the marvelous doings of the instrument, and for a time the greatest scientific minds of the world were interested iv its queer pranks. Such men as Tyndall and Faraday were drawn Into controversies pro and con over the merits of this occult agency. Exhaustive essays were written and learned lectures delivered to prove that planchette was a fraud and to prove that planchette's powers were supernatural. But it all ended where it began. The deepest study and the most careful analy sis of the wiles and ways of planchette developed nothing of scientific value either to the student of the occult or the natural forces. And so the planchette fever died as quickly as it had grown. Men and women went back to their workaday world or con tinued their occult studies unuer different auspices. Planchette had it« little day nnd then died a natural death. Or, if it did not i die entirely, it lapsed into a slate of coma j from whicn it is only now being resur- I rected. To-day, in San Fraucisco aud in j Oakland, and perhaps In other parts of ihe world, great numbers of men and women are bent on solving the mysteries i that still cling to this little contrivance. And it is all because of that irrepressible j desire of man to penetrate the mysteries j of the future. f ,v What does to-morrow hold for me. That is the question nearest the heart of most men to-day. lt is a very part of the commercial spirit of the age. And as yet science has made no advances toward placing the means within reach of answer ing it. So planchette comes again to fill the gap between the known and the un known. What started the fever no one seems to i know. 'Hint it has been started and has already interested hundreds of intelligent men and women no one doubts, for the evi dence is clear. You know what planchette is, do you j not, and how it operates? Some have thought there was a hidden secret in its I construction, but this is wrong. Never was a wonderful device more simply con trived; There is first a heart-shaped cedar board. Pendant from the points of the angle are little legs with metal or wooden castors. At the end of the board is an aperture for the insertion of a lead pencil. Those who fit to planchette for communi cations from this world or the next place a baud each on the surface of the board, then wait till the ""spirit moves."" And the spirit has been moving pretty rapidly in these parts of the world for the last few nights. Dire things have been fore told and timely warnings given. Ordinarily planchette will write out what it has to say if time be given i\ but the quicker way is to write the alphabet and the simple negative and affirmative on a large sheet of white paper and let plan chette spell out its messages by pointing to tbe letters. It was this method pursued py a party of well-known clubmen who began as i skeptics Friday evening and went home at I daybreak firmly convinced that there were i at least many things that they had little j dreamed of In their phiiosophy. Only two members of the party placed tbeir hands on the instrument at one time. The others j looked on and scoffed. ""We were all unbelievers when we sat down to that table,"" said the member of the party who told the story to a Call man yesterday. ""For a while planchetie refused to move and we were almost on the point of giving it up for the night, when, without un Instant warning, the in strument gave a sudden jerk and almost flew from uuder the fingers of Jones and Smith. ""Roth the men turned pale at this and in order to rally themselves they accused each other of having moved the planchette. On their honor both men denied this, but since neither had believed his own accusa tion the denials were useless. ""I think it was a wife or a sister of Jones that came first. I bave forgotten the name of the spirit or influence, or whatever it was, that purported to move the instrument, but the information it im parted can be easily verified or disproved when the next news from Samoa arrives. ""It spelled out 'Apia' first, very clearly and unhesitatingly. Then it went on to say that a terrible hurricane would sweep over the Samoan Islands on the 10th of November and that two vessels would be lost In the storm. And touching this event it would say no more, though we plied it with queries for a long time. ""Another influence came. I remember tbe name, but shall not give it. 'Dead or living?' asked Smith. 'Living,' came the answer, but Smith knew this already, for the name it gave was the name of his sweetheart. 'What have you to tell me?' queried Smith, and then he wished he had not, for the answer that came distressed bim sorely. ""Twill not marry you,' it spelled out with painful accuracy. 'Why not?', was the natural question that followed when Smith had recovered his presence of mind and bad determined to face it out. 'Because I like D— letter,' came the answer. ""Then two men glared at each other for a moment, for D— sat at the opposite end of the table waiting bis turn to try plan chette.^^StHß^^B^o96iQH''SK^ ""Now, if It were not already notorious that D— hail been a little soft on Smith's sweetheart of late we would have passed over this little incident as one of the vagaries of plancbette. But Smith couldn't take it in this light. He was crushed, and Invited D— to take his place. 1 needn't tell you that D— declined the invitation, but I would stake a small sum that"" D— has his bands on a plancbette this moment. a,\*'l look Smith's place at the planchette and presently the' thing began ;to move again. This time it discarded the use of the alphabet and gave its message in writ ing. ""Now, I am not going to place any reli ance on this thing till I see how it turns out, but the message that came to me is Important if it is true. '""I am an enemy,' it wrote. '""Are you going to thrash him?' asked Jone?, who likes to be facetious when there is the least call for it. .""'No!' said planchette. Then after a pause it carefully wrote out, '1 am going to harm him. He is my enemy and I will be revenged.' ""Well, all this meant nothing without a name, and no name had been given yet. Again I asked for the name and ■it not only wrote oat the name of tbe man who happens to be smarting under a very just punishment that i Inflicted upon, him, but wrote it in bis own handwriting. a ''You should have seen some of the faces of the men who sal about that table when they recognized the handwriting. One of the men who bad laughed loudest and scoffed the most when we first sat down found it necessary to go outside for fresh air."" There was no more laughter tbat evening. i ""Then it came into my bead to ask plan chette something about itself, but before we put the questions both Jones and my self were blindfolded. This precaution is unnecessary, for it is simply impossible to move planchette as it does move without exerting a physical force that would be readily detected. However, we did this more to convince ourselves than others. "".'Are you inspired?' asked. ""'Yes,' came the answer. 'By a good power?' ""The instrument fairly flew to the word 'no.' 'By the devil said Jones. 'The devil,' it spelled out without the least hesitation. s: 'Who are you?' I inquired. 'An agent of the devil,' replied plan chetie, and this time in writing. ""And after that there was not a man in the room brave enough to put bis hand on that instrument.""

Perhaps tho most remarkable le- Iccnt experiences with it arc those of Mrs, John Curran of St, Louis. Sho has been in communication, she says, with the spirit of Patience Worth, a woman beliovcd to have existed in lhe Colonial days and who not only has sent philosophical axioms that are characteristic of tho Puritans but even has gone to tho extent of sending outlines of plays and es says and has gone extensively Into the dictation of poetry. More than 300,000 words havo been received from this supposed spirit in ihieo years. Patience Worth talks In a strange t English that is archaic and not J 1 found in the best authors and yet j may have at one time been the tongue of Inhabitants of this coun try. Long condemned by religious as the direct agency of satan and by i skeptics as the toy of the supcrsti- tlous, the ouija board is being ro f stored to its own former popularity I through the curiosity of society wo men. In many parts of the country oo clety women are devoting their timo to ""communicating"" with spirits in tho other world. Many sti'ango results of such com munications are reported and a ao t clety woman is unhappy indeed if she hasn't at least one good spirit i in tho world of mystery who is al B ways ready to send a message at her m, control's pleasure. Ill Even in staid St. Louis where so- lit! cIety women arc supposed to bo 1$ very conservative, tho ouija board il has been, restored to favor whilo HA in New York and In various cities of the east it is quite the ""rage."" In St Louis Mrs. John H. Curran has gotten into touch with one Pa tience Worth of Spiritland and has transcribed more than 300,000 words thiough the ouija board, all of which will be published at some future date. Patience Worth is believed from her peculiar choice of words and phraseology to be a Colonial dame, who has been wandering about In space for a long time, burning to send her messages back to the mun dane sphere yet finding no source of communication until Mrs. Curran bought a ouija board and com menced taking messages. THROUGH CURIOSITY. The board Avas purchased through curiosity. There is something fas cinating about the tales told of tho little board, whether they be- true or false. It is known that a num ber of people have asked the board to tell them in what land their dead iclativcs liugercd and were shocked considerable- when the naughty Utile hoard spelled out a word starling A ith an H and ending with an L. Many have thought that the words written bv the board were the result of the mental influences oC the per son opeiating it. while others have credited it with supernatural pow ers. In tho use of tho board at the Cur ran home, Mrs. Curran always is one of two whose ""hands are on the board. The latter is arranged on two wheels and has a pencil at the end. As the vibration of the fingers of tho holders develops the pencil moves over a sheet of paper and prints numerals o'r letters of the al phabet, While Mrs. Curran operates tho board her husband transcribes tho message as sho reads it to him. The ""Patience Worth"" matter be gan to be transcribed in June, 1913. Since that time Mrs. Curran has made public as the products of Pa tience Worth a six-act play entitled ""Red Wing."" a novel called ""Tclka"" and numerous verses, essays and bits of philosiphy. The quaint language of these writ ings has probably attracted more at tention than their literary merit, tho latter being a matter of some dis cussion. They are in an antique language, not the English of Chau cer, Spenser or any other well- known classic English writer, but possibly more like the common speech of the English people of an early day. It is known to travelers that an antique, almost archaic, form of English still Is spoken in remote communities of England. Theie are districts of England whose inhabi tants have great difficulty in under standing or in making themselves understood by the coster-cockney class. Mrs. Curran, however, says sho has no personal acquaintance with such speech and that she has not gone farther in her study of classic English than other well read per sons. The language used' by Patience Worth, she explains, is as strange to her as It is to others. Mrs. Curran recently gave to the Fapyrus Club of St. Louis some of her messages from Patience Worth, one of them being a special messago that Patience had sent the club. It read: PATIENCE WORTH'S MESSAGE. Good Dames and SIrrahs At the board thou hast sat and cat of earth's grow. Aye, and now do ye cat o' the grow thou knowest not the looting place of. Yea, thou shalt hark unto the woid o' MEN, and jet they do to prate o' DAME. Ayca, and methlnks 'tis a word aspoke' amany, that be not the word that hid 'pon the lung, lest the Dame be offended I Aye, then come thou and ait 'bout the board, and thine cars shall hark tmto the words o' me, and thou shalt sec the cloth o' me the hands o' the loves o' mc did to fashion out for me. Ayea, I then shall sit me meek, and thread mc up a bobbins full for the next o' put. Ayca, and 'tis frocked that I shall to be, and nay dame shall see! Awoe! Nay, this be a piddlc-put-tlng, good folk! Athin (within) thy heart shall set the me o' me at thy go ahence. And 'tis nhope I be 'tis a loving wampth 'twill find. And so dost thou to smile, 'tis Bweets and love 1 cast thee. And doth thy heart to shut it up, lo, then shall I to knock till thou dost leave me in. A night o' cheer. A heart o' love! A God's wish o' loving 'pon thy day. Anight! Anight! HOW IT BEGAN. Mrs. Curran told her audience of her first experiences with tho ouija WW w board and of the puzzling messages received. Later sho used the'board together with Mrs Emily Grant Hutchings and began to receive sentences which foimcd maxims and philosophical paragrapbs. Then came the announcement: ""Many moons ago I lived. Patience Worth, my namo. If thou shalt live then so shall I. I make my bread by thy hearth"" The word ""bread."" Mrs. Currau later learned, lefeired to the literary products embodied in the messages. Mrs. Curran said she would not at tempt to say whelhcr Patience Worth was a spirit, but spoko of ,ber as a beautiful personality, which had come to seem not a mystery but a fellowship. She said the messages came to her in daylight as well as at night and that there is no trance connected with them. ""The words come in sort o a rhythm,"" Mrs. Curran explained, ""and I record just what comes whether I understand it or not."" Pnticuce has been tested by rnoro than 200 persons and her messages have never varied. A professor from the University of Indiana visltod Mrs. Cunan to investigate her com munication with Patience Worth. William Marion' Reedy, editor of the Mirror, and Caspar Yost, editor of a SL Louis newspaper, became ac quainted with Patience Worth and both declaic her genuine. Yost has described her as a ""spinster of un certain age; a writer, but a poet by preference. White the average spirit stalks dismal and wailing lugubri ously through the flnito world, Pa tience comes with a laugh, Yost said. She remarks. ''I be no sorrj' singer,"" and proves it by many witticisms. EDITOR DESCRIBES HER. Reedy calls Patience's doctrines Pantelstic. He describes her as follows: ""She fs a little woman, dressed In gtaj; with a little bonnet, ribbons coming down and tied under her chin. There are lines in her face, not the re written wrinkles of the smiles or her youth, but the results of ex perience Her eyes are biown liico autumn leaves after a rain. She Is -between 45 and 50 years old, spright ly, dainty, delicate. ""Sho has stood beside the stock ade helping a good man load a gun, while he defends the settlement against the savage horde of In dians."" Reedy said the theory was ad vanced that she was filled in an In dian massacre and this question was askcu of her. Sho intimated that something of this sort had happened to her and she was asked if she had not been taken captive oy the In dians. ""Nay, something worse,"" was her reply. '.'She speaks an English almost pure and undefiled,"" Reedy said of her ""There is an absence from it of all the derivatives of France and Rome, and sho rarely uses a word of more than two syllables. Her an swers are- diredt and almost invari ably in parables. She has respect for her interlocutor's intelligence."" Reedy said sho is not another Sappho, or George Elliott, or Mrs. Humphrey ward nor a Sara Teas dale,' but rather echoes of all of thct poets. He said theie runs a consist ent character through her works and in two years she has not gotten ""out of chaiactcr."" Sho never has used a modern word or expression and he illustrated the seeming significance of this by pointing out how difficult it would be for a man trained In Irish or negro dialect to make a 30 minute talk without breaking out of the character. ""She has nothing lo tell, in my opinion, ""Reedy said, ""but she com mands my admiration and reverence. She tells nothing- that we have not heard from tho old masters and bards."" ""What of the divinity of Christ?"" Kcody at one time asked her through the ouijd board. She answered, ""He bought thee of his loving."" ""What of love?"" he asked. ""Tho love there is but tho o'er drip of lovo here"" came the respou&c of tho board. ""Describe tho place where you are?"" sho was asked. ""Think you ""Patience Worth,"" Mythical Character, Startles Literary World With Her Quaint I English In Essays, Plays and H Novels Noted Writers Are H Puzzled Over the Output of H This Woman Supposed to H Have i Lived 300 Years Ago H there Is bottom or top; this is a walless country."" ""Can you do anything you want over there 7"" The answer was: ""When you put the will you put the limit."" ""Put"" in Patience's vocabulary re sponds to the modern verb ""to do."" ""Patience may be a second person ality of Mrs. Curran,"" -Reedy sato. ""but she teaches a lovo that is greater than we can conceive and that death is the keeper of unknown redemption."" LITTLE COLONIAL DAME. Mrs. Emily Hutchings, who -was one of the first to receive 'with Mrs. Curran the messages from Patlenco Worth, said the first glimmering or the quaint personality of the little Colonial dame came in the maxim: ""A busy saw gathereth no rust."" One of the sentiments expressed by Patience Worth is: ""A blighted bud may hold a sweeter message than the lovllest flower; for God hath kissed her wounded heart and left a promise there."" Of the seances, Mrs. Curran says: ""I sit with a friend, our hands up on the board, which I havo come to believe is nothing more than a con centrator. There is no trance. Ev erything is quiet with the exception of Patience Worth. The only definite part is that while I put my thoughts awhither, as Patience would Bay, and immediately the sto ries, poems, plays., parables, or whatever her work for the sitting IH may be, is shown to mo in tiny pic- JH lures, beautiful and distinct a3 IH though my eyes saw them. ""The characters move and speak H and my hands fly over the letters jH much too fast for me to anticipate- H even one word. J ""I cannot account for the langu- jH age.

SIX years ago Mrs. John H Curran, of St. Louis, a peculiarly healthy-minded, normal young woman, who is the wife of the former Immigration Commis sioner of Misitvouri, began for amusement to experiment with the ouija board. This peculiar instrument for receiv ing meaaages foom the beyond"" consists of a flat wooden board, about two feet long by one and a half wide, on which are th? letters of the alphabet, the numerala up to ten and the words ''Yea,"" ""Mo,"" ""Don't know"" and ""Good-by."" A little heart-shaped table on three legs is placed on top of the board. The sitters place the board upon their knees, the finger tips of both hands lightly upon the heart-shaped table. After a while an ""influence,"" ""apirit"" or ""spook"" begins to move the heart-shaped board, whose narrow end then points to the letters, spell ing out the words of ?ta* message. A third person, an observer, acts as amenuensis, taking down the letters as the pointer indicates them. The ""mestages"" are accounted for by non-spiritualista as an expression of the sub-conscious self of one or both of the sitters; the mysterious movement of the table is supposed to be due to unconscious muscle rhythms of the hands of the sitters. Whatever the explanation, Mrs. Curran began to hear from someone who signed herself ""Patience Worth"" and who spelled out upon the board sentences in remarkable English?archaic, a forgotten dialect. This ghostly per sonage speedily developed into the strongest kind of a personality. She had been, she wrote, a maiden of Dor setshire. England, who lived about 1650. She was a weaver's daughter, an only child. She wrote that ""my thumb is thick from twisting flax"" and speaks of deliver ing fine linen to the ""castle folk."" Her father left to come to America, and after the death of her mother. Patience says she followed him to the new world. ?She was then thirty-five. Her new home was in the vicinity of Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket. Near there she tv a? buried, and now, she says, ""a tree grows out of my grave."" Soon she began to dictate stories and poems with ex traordinary rapidity and facility. The first book pub lished was ""Patience Worth."" The ""Sorry Tale,"" a story based on the episode of the impenitent thief on Ihe cross, came out in 1916 and ""Hope Trueblood."" the last book, was a story of old England. The remarkable literary excellence of these writings attracted widespread attention. Their dialect passed every teat of experts. It was proven that Mrs. Curran had no previous knowledge of them, nor had she the education displayed by the com munications. Dr. Martin F. Prince, the famous neurologist, diagnosed Patience ""asa sub-conscious personality of Mrs. Curran and offered to rid her of it by hypnotism. Mrs. Curran refused to have ""Patience"" banished by this means or any other, and scoffs at the sub conscious theory. Other distinguished scientists studied her case, but with no better results. For three years the ""ghost"" of Patience Worth?or whatever it is that responda to that nam?2?had been dic tating to Mrs. Curran by means of the oirija board as a concentrator. One book had been printed, another waa on the way to the printer. The first book was already promising an excellent sale. Reviews had been flattering and the publie was becoming interested Then one evening, after the Currans had been' dis cussing this materialistically agreeable result of the.man ifestations, Patience Worth exploded a bombshell. In the quaint old English words which she uses she an nounced that inasmuch an there ""seemed to be some money in sight."" and since it did not belong to the Cur rans. ""but to God,"" that they should seek ""a wee babe that had nothing, nothing and take it and care for iti"" This was. indeed, disconcerting. The Curran house was a well-filled one. There was a grandfather, a mother in-law, a stepdaughter and the husband and wife. Be sides, they had counted upon using the money for thorn selves. Patience, however, was determined and explicit. Sho caustically called attention to the fact that the emolu menta of her bock did not belong to those who simply took down her dictation, but that as the author and main spring of the volume the returns from it were hers to do with aa she Dleased. ""I am a weaver of cloth,"" said Patience on that night, in the curious imagery she loves to use, ""and this cloth weave is not for him who hath. Thou ehalt seek a wee one who hath naught, and thou shalt deliver the goods of me unto it? hands, and ye shalt speak ita name ?Patience Worth.""* This was an order, not a request 1 And to it when the first shock of surprise had worn off the Currans gladly bowed. ??L?ook ye.'' the '^heat** went on, ""this shall be one who is sorely in need, mind ye Ye ?hall whisper sweets unto it. even unto the wee ear that knoweth not thy words, and tell unto it of a fairy dame who shall minister unto it and of Him who sent her And she shell be the love of all who love me and shall smile sweeta unto them.*' ""But why a girl instead of a boyt"" the Currans aaked anxiously. ""Ye aee,'* answered Patience cryptically enough, ""a man laddie hath man'? cunning, but the wee dame??ah, I know I"" The Curran? quite naturally asked about the parent age of the child, ita legitimacy and many other important things, not the least of which was a description of it so that they might know when they bad found tbe babe Patience had in mind She gave them certain directions???rather vague; told them ""not to mind earth's law but God's""?referring unquestionably to the matter of parentage and to watch close if there were any blood taints, but not to go back further than the grandparent?.. She wanted the child dressed simply, she concluded, and asked thai ""about its neck thou ?halt hang a sign of Him."" The Curran?, and rightly it, turned out later, construed this to mean cross."" ""Ye shall be upon tbe path! E'en now the wee one is waiting,"" she urged. So the hunt began for a child who wouid answer the description. The entire ""Patience Worth"" clan was sent out on the seareh. Two physicians were selected to ex amine it when found for blood taint! Much ground wa? covered in the next month. There were handicaps?an interesting one the refusal by a certain large St. Louis foundling institution to allow any baby to be taken from there because ""Mrs. Curran wrote on a ouija board."" During this search ""Patience,"" who seems to have a strange sense of humor at times, remained silent. Then one night, according to Mrs. Curran, she directed them to cease, telling them there was no use in looking for ""one that was not whole,"" and that in due time certain signs would be given them whereby they would know what to do adding that if they did continue it would be ""like a wolf seeking for a fat fowl to feed well upon when the bird was still in the egg."" After this, other weeks passed by without any reference being made by ""Patience Worth"" to the matter. Then one morning Mrs. Curran met an old friend whom she had not seen for years, and in the course of a ride together told some of the details of the quest for the baby. The friend, in return, told of a young wife who was about to become a mother, who was practically home less and friendless, and whose husband had been killed some time before in a mill accident. That night g mes sage from ""Patience Worth"" indicated that at last the Curraros were on the right track and that which she had prophesied M'as about to occur. The next day Mrs. Curran went to see this woman, who was very ill. A fever of preparation began imme diately. Layette cradle, perambulator, lawyers, adoption papers?everything was made ready just as though the thing were already settled. Seemingly the possibility that the expected child might be a boy was never for a moment considered. The mother-to-be signed the adoption papers, but held them under the agreement that if she lived she was to keep the expected child, but that if she died, then the Currans were to have the baby. Six weeks later, as Mrs Curran was writing with ""Patience"" upon the now well-known ""Sorry Tale,"" the ""ghost"" stopped the dictation at exactly nine o'clock. ""This be enough,"" she wrote, and the board became quiet.",No timeline found

Whether there is truth in a statmmnt that the ouija board is adding patients to Wasinta asums through disturbing infinenoes augon District mentalitin, students of mental phenomena will be inteAsted in the fact that the board takes its name from the French word oui (yes) and the German word ja (yes). Its origin is somewhat obscure. Both the planohette and ouija, somewhat simila in appearanes, date back to about 1855, and for a while were objects of consider able superstition. The planchette is a small board fitted with a pencil and two casters, made to move easily over a sheet of paper when the hands rest lightly on it. The dictionary says the ouija ""is a form of planchatte used in spiritualistic seaness or the like. It consists of two parts, a board containing the al phabet and other characters, and a planehette, with a pointer substituted for the pencil."" Investigation of automatic writings fail to find that the two boards have any origin in the mysticisms of Egypt. One writer is of the opinion that the iret at tempt in ouijaing was made by a man on his wife's breadboard. The skeptical refer to the board as wholly a modem trick afair which has no connection with Eastern or other metaphysics. Some of the noted spiritualists of the world make use of the ouija or planchette and carefully study the results. An able group of psychologists regard the ouija as a dangerous deception. Their theory is that the subconscious mind of the operator directs the fingers in such a way as to convey the information hoped for. The operator, they hold, is as innocent of this subconscious process as a sleep-walker is of what, he is doing, and naturally puts a supernatural con struction on the outcome. Leading spiritualists and other believers in higher agencies than natural ones, confident that communica tion with the other world is not only established but is developing into an understanding that will glorify humanity, are willing to accept the ouija board or any other method of transmission that will add ti the in formation they feel they now possess.

We accept this as true so long as the person inter viewed is present in the flesh, but when it comes to the honesty and reliability of those persons who communicate with the de parted spirits, we draw the line. There we halt. An inter view with a pencil and pad as the mediums is something reason able, but when the pencil and pad are thrown away, and a table or ouija board duplicated, then the thing begins to look spooky. And—just think—you could quote the poor spirit anyway you wanted to, and yet he, it, or she, would have no recourse, except possibly by haunting you. And anyone hav ing the nerve to hold a telepathic conflab with a spirit would be above fearing a ghost. Senator Sorghum in the flesh could scare the editor into making a correction, or a retraction, but how could a spirit institute libel proceedings against anyone? There is some credulity behind even the most serious scien tific facts, especially in the earlier stages of their development. But there is considerable difference between a speck of credul ity and a great expanse of human gullibility. Any violent dis turbance, like the great war, tends to distort people’s emotions and reason, even more than it does their action and will. This must be the explanation of the tidal wave oi spiritualism that is now sweeping this country. The revers >n to the belief in the existence of ghosts is simply the bringing into pronounced relief of the state of mind that our ancestors exhibited. The burning of witches at Salem was of its fruitage. Spiritualism is superstition curtailed by law. As its disciples no longer have access to the stake and the guillotine, they must amuse themselves as best they can with table-rappings, ouija boards, and other such paraphernalia. The fact that such men a3 Sir Richard Crookes and Sir Oliver Lodge are converts to spiritualism gives little support to the hoax, for even a layman can find serious flaws in their evi dence, and such men as Joseph Jastrow and Sir Edward Clodd can veritably tear their tenets to shreds. From its inception, spiritualism has been founded on trickery and frauds, and no proof has yet been brought forward showing that the present revival is not concocted of the same ingredients. Even if such were not the case, we have our hands full of problems as it is, without giving heed to the imaginary gibbering of disembodied ghosts.",No timeline found

""Mrs. It,"" the ghost of 13 Highworth rd., is back again—with a playmate. Only recently the haunt was ex orcized by a Church of England vicar in a religious rite to drive away spirits taken from early Cristian records. The peace of No. 13 was short lived. Mr. and Mrs. William Ba ber, who live in the house, say the ghost now does a nightly routine up and down the stairs with an unidentified partner. Sometimes it sounds like they're dancing, sometimes like wrestling. The Baber theory is that the original ghost—which they named ""Mrs. It""—is that of a woman who died in the house 18 years ago. ""Mrs. It"" first began prowling around the place in December. The vicar, the Rev. Francis Maddock, went through a rite of exorcism after a month of nightly uproar at No. 13. One night the Babers called in a spiritualist. All they found out is that ""Mrs. It"" (1) speaks a foreign language—possibly Russian and (2) is an atrocious speller.

UNSEEN FORCES AT WORK. Some Uncanny Pranks of a Little Instrument That Once Held the Attention of the World. There Is a planchette fever in San Fran cisco. Clubs of patient sitters, anxious to hold communion with the dead and distant liv ing, have been formed here and in Oak land. Daily and nightly seances are being held. Plancbette is old, so old that it is almost new again. Early in the fifties the weird little contrivance was invented and ten years later nearly the whole civilized world was teaming with a recital of its wonders. The most uncanny tales were related of the marvelous doings of the instrument, and for a time the greatest scientific minds of the world were interested iv its queer pranks. Such men as Tyndall and Faraday were drawn Into controversies pro and con over the merits of this occult agency. Exhaustive essays were written and learned lectures delivered to prove that planchette was a fraud and to prove that planchette's powers were supernatural. But it all ended where it began. The deepest study and the most careful analy sis of the wiles and ways of planchette developed nothing of scientific value either to the student of the occult or the natural forces. And so the planchette fever died as quickly as it had grown. Men and women went back to their workaday world or con tinued their occult studies unuer different auspices. Planchette had it« little day nnd then died a natural death. Or, if it did not i die entirely, it lapsed into a slate of coma j from whicn it is only now being resur- I rected. To-day, in San Fraucisco aud in j Oakland, and perhaps In other parts of ihe world, great numbers of men and women are bent on solving the mysteries i that still cling to this little contrivance. And it is all because of that irrepressible j desire of man to penetrate the mysteries j of the future. f ,v What does to-morrow hold for me. That is the question nearest the heart of most men to-day. lt is a very part of the commercial spirit of the age. And as yet science has made no advances toward placing the means within reach of answer ing it. So planchette comes again to fill the gap between the known and the un known. What started the fever no one seems to i know. 'Hint it has been started and has already interested hundreds of intelligent men and women no one doubts, for the evi dence is clear. You know what planchette is, do you j not, and how it operates? Some have thought there was a hidden secret in its I construction, but this is wrong. Never was a wonderful device more simply con trived; There is first a heart-shaped cedar board. Pendant from the points of the angle are little legs with metal or wooden castors. At the end of the board is an aperture for the insertion of a lead pencil. Those who fit to planchette for communi cations from this world or the next place a baud each on the surface of the board, then wait till the ""spirit moves."" And the spirit has been moving pretty rapidly in these parts of the world for the last few nights. Dire things have been fore told and timely warnings given. Ordinarily planchette will write out what it has to say if time be given i\ but the quicker way is to write the alphabet and the simple negative and affirmative on a large sheet of white paper and let plan chette spell out its messages by pointing to tbe letters. It was this method pursued py a party of well-known clubmen who began as i skeptics Friday evening and went home at I daybreak firmly convinced that there were i at least many things that they had little j dreamed of In their phiiosophy. Only two members of the party placed tbeir hands on the instrument at one time. The others j looked on and scoffed. ""We were all unbelievers when we sat down to that table,"" said the member of the party who told the story to a Call man yesterday. ""For a while planchetie refused to move and we were almost on the point of giving it up for the night, when, without un Instant warning, the in strument gave a sudden jerk and almost flew from uuder the fingers of Jones and Smith. ""Roth the men turned pale at this and in order to rally themselves they accused each other of having moved the planchette. On their honor both men denied this, but since neither had believed his own accusa tion the denials were useless. ""I think it was a wife or a sister of Jones that came first. I bave forgotten the name of the spirit or influence, or whatever it was, that purported to move the instrument, but the information it im parted can be easily verified or disproved when the next news from Samoa arrives. ""It spelled out 'Apia' first, very clearly and unhesitatingly. Then it went on to say that a terrible hurricane would sweep over the Samoan Islands on the 10th of November and that two vessels would be lost In the storm. And touching this event it would say no more, though we plied it with queries for a long time. ""Another influence came. I remember tbe name, but shall not give it. 'Dead or living?' asked Smith. 'Living,' came the answer, but Smith knew this already, for the name it gave was the name of his sweetheart. 'What have you to tell me?' queried Smith, and then he wished he had not, for the answer that came distressed bim sorely. ""Twill not marry you,' it spelled out with painful accuracy. 'Why not?', was the natural question that followed when Smith had recovered his presence of mind and bad determined to face it out. 'Because I like D— letter,' came the answer. ""Then two men glared at each other for a moment, for D— sat at the opposite end of the table waiting bis turn to try plan chette.^^StHß^^B^o96iQH''SK^ ""Now, if It were not already notorious that D— hail been a little soft on Smith's sweetheart of late we would have passed over this little incident as one of the vagaries of plancbette. But Smith couldn't take it in this light. He was crushed, and Invited D— to take his place. 1 needn't tell you that D— declined the invitation, but I would stake a small sum that"" D— has his bands on a plancbette this moment. a,\*'l look Smith's place at the planchette and presently the' thing began ;to move again. This time it discarded the use of the alphabet and gave its message in writ ing. ""Now, I am not going to place any reli ance on this thing till I see how it turns out, but the message that came to me is Important if it is true. '""I am an enemy,' it wrote. '""Are you going to thrash him?' asked Jone?, who likes to be facetious when there is the least call for it. .""'No!' said planchette. Then after a pause it carefully wrote out, '1 am going to harm him. He is my enemy and I will be revenged.' ""Well, all this meant nothing without a name, and no name had been given yet. Again I asked for the name and ■it not only wrote oat the name of tbe man who happens to be smarting under a very just punishment that i Inflicted upon, him, but wrote it in bis own handwriting. a ''You should have seen some of the faces of the men who sal about that table when they recognized the handwriting. One of the men who bad laughed loudest and scoffed the most when we first sat down found it necessary to go outside for fresh air."" There was no more laughter tbat evening. i ""Then it came into my bead to ask plan chette something about itself, but before we put the questions both Jones and my self were blindfolded. This precaution is unnecessary, for it is simply impossible to move planchette as it does move without exerting a physical force that would be readily detected. However, we did this more to convince ourselves than others. "".'Are you inspired?' asked. ""'Yes,' came the answer. 'By a good power?' ""The instrument fairly flew to the word 'no.' 'By the devil said Jones. 'The devil,' it spelled out without the least hesitation. s: 'Who are you?' I inquired. 'An agent of the devil,' replied plan chetie, and this time in writing. ""And after that there was not a man in the room brave enough to put bis hand on that instrument."" The above questions and answers can be vouched for by -more than one man whose word in the commercial world is as good as his bond, and many similar dia logues might be cited to prove— prove well, to prove that plancbette has a strong hold on the people of this city once more. Whether the craze will die out before it reaches any great proportions again re mains to be seen.",No timeline found

Perhaps tho most remarkable le- Iccnt experiences with it arc those of Mrs, John Curran of St, Louis. Sho has been in communication, she says, with the spirit of Patience Worth, a woman beliovcd to have existed in lhe Colonial days and who not only has sent philosophical axioms that are characteristic of tho Puritans but even has gone to tho extent of sending outlines of plays and es says and has gone extensively Into the dictation of poetry. More than 300,000 words havo been received from this supposed spirit in ihieo years. Patience Worth talks In a strange t English that is archaic and not J 1 found in the best authors and yet j may have at one time been the tongue of Inhabitants of this coun try. Long condemned by religious as the direct agency of satan and by i skeptics as the toy of the supcrsti- tlous, the ouija board is being ro f stored to its own former popularity I through the curiosity of society wo men. In many parts of the country oo clety women are devoting their timo to ""communicating"" with spirits in tho other world. Many sti'ango results of such com munications are reported and a ao t clety woman is unhappy indeed if she hasn't at least one good spirit i in tho world of mystery who is al B) ways ready to send a message at her m, control's pleasure. Ill Even in staid St. Louis where so- lit! cIety women arc supposed to bo 1$ very conservative, tho ouija board il has been, restored to favor whilo HA in New York and In various cities of the east it is quite the ""rage."" In St Louis Mrs. John H. Curran has gotten into touch with one Pa tience Worth of Spiritland and has transcribed more than 300,000 words thiough the ouija board, all of which will be published at some future date. Patience Worth is believed from her peculiar choice of words and phraseology to be a Colonial dame, who has been wandering about In space for a long time, burning to send her messages back to the mun dane sphere yet finding no source of communication until Mrs. Curran bought a ouija board and com menced taking messages. THROUGH CURIOSITY. The board Avas purchased through curiosity. There is something fas cinating about the tales told of tho little board, whether they be- true or false. It is known that a num ber of people have asked the board to tell them in what land their dead iclativcs liugercd and were shocked considerable- when the naughty Utile hoard spelled out a word starling A ith an H and ending with an L. Many have thought that the words written bv the board were the result of the mental influences oC the per son opeiating it. while others have credited it with supernatural pow ers. In tho use of tho board at the Cur ran home, Mrs. Curran always is one of two whose ""hands are on the board. The latter is arranged on two wheels and has a pencil at the end. As the vibration of the fingers of tho holders develops the pencil moves over a sheet of paper and prints numerals o'r letters of the al phabet, While Mrs. Curran operates tho board her husband transcribes tho message as sho reads it to him. The ""Patience Worth"" matter be gan to be transcribed in June, 1913. Since that time Mrs. Curran has made public as the products of Pa tience Worth a six-act play entitled ""Red Wing."" a novel called ""Tclka"" and numerous verses, essays and bits of philosiphy. The quaint language of these writ ings has probably attracted more at tention than their literary merit, tho latter being a matter of some dis cussion. They are in an antique language, not the English of Chau cer, Spenser or any other well- known classic English writer, but possibly more like the common speech of the English people of an early day. It is known to travelers that an antique, almost archaic, form of English still Is spoken in remote communities of England. Theie are districts of England whose inhabi tants have great difficulty in under standing or in making themselves understood by the coster-cockney class. Mrs. Curran, however, says sho has no personal acquaintance with such speech and that she has not gone farther in her study of classic English than other well read per sons. The language used' by Patience Worth, she explains, is as strange to her as It is to others. Mrs. Curran recently gave to the Fapyrus Club of St. Louis some of her messages from Patience Worth, one of them being a special messago that Patience had sent the club. It read: PATIENCE WORTH'S MESSAGE. Good Dames and SIrrahs At the board thou hast sat and cat of earth's grow. Aye, and now do ye cat o' the grow thou knowest not the looting place of. Yea, thou shalt hark unto the woid o' MEN, and jet they do to prate o' DAME. Ayca, and methlnks 'tis a word aspoke' amany, that be not the word that hid 'pon the lung, lest the Dame be offended I Aye, then come thou and ait 'bout the board, and thine cars shall hark tmto the words o' me, and thou shalt sec the cloth o' me the hands o' the loves o' mc did to fashion out for me. Ayea, I then shall sit me meek, and thread mc up a bobbins full for the next o' put. Ayca, and 'tis frocked that I shall to be, and nay dame shall see! Awoe!

A God's wish o' loving 'pon thy day. Anight! Anight! HOW IT BEGAN. Mrs. Curran told her audience of her first experiences with tho ouija WW w board and of the puzzling messages received. Later sho used the'board together with Mrs Emily Grant Hutchings and began to receive sentences which foimcd maxims and philosophical paragrapbs. Then came the announcement: ""Many moons ago I lived. Patience Worth, my namo. If thou shalt live then so shall I. I make my bread by thy hearth"" The word ""bread."" Mrs. Currau later learned, lefeired to the literary products embodied in the messages. Mrs. Curran said she would not at tempt to say whelhcr Patience Worth was a spirit, but spoko of ,ber as a beautiful personality, which had come to seem not a mystery but a fellowship. She said the messages came to her in daylight as well as at night and that there is no trance connected with them. ""The words come in sort o a rhythm,"" Mrs. Curran explained, ""and I record just what comes whether I understand it or not."" Pnticuce has been tested by rnoro than 200 persons and her messages have never varied. A professor from the University of Indiana visltod Mrs. Cunan to investigate her com munication with Patience Worth. William Marion' Reedy, editor of the Mirror, and Caspar Yost, editor of a SL Louis newspaper, became ac quainted with Patience Worth and both declaic her genuine. Yost has described her as a ""spinster of un certain age; a writer, but a poet by preference. White the average spirit stalks dismal and wailing lugubri ously through the flnito world, Pa tience comes with a laugh, Yost said. She remarks. ''I be no sorrj' singer,"" and proves it by many witticisms. EDITOR DESCRIBES HER. Reedy calls Patience's doctrines Pantelstic. He describes her as follows: ""She fs a little woman, dressed In gtaj; with a little bonnet, ribbons coming down and tied under her chin. There are lines in her face, not the re written wrinkles of the smiles or her youth, but the results of ex perience Her eyes are biown liico autumn leaves after a rain. She Is -between 45 and 50 years old, spright ly, dainty, delicate. ""Sho has stood beside the stock ade helping a good man load a gun, while he defends the settlement against the savage horde of In dians."" Reedy said the theory was ad vanced that she was filled in an In dian massacre and this question was askcu of her. Sho intimated that something of this sort had happened to her and she was asked if she had not been taken captive oy the In dians. ""Nay, something worse,"" was her reply. '.'She speaks an English almost pure and undefiled,"" Reedy said of her ""There is an absence from it of all the derivatives of France and Rome, and sho rarely uses a word of more than two syllables. Her an swers are- diredt and almost invari ably in parables. She has respect for her interlocutor's intelligence."" Reedy said sho is not another Sappho, or George Elliott, or Mrs. Humphrey ward nor a Sara Teas dale,' but rather echoes of all of thct poets. He said theie runs a consist ent character through her works and in two years she has not gotten ""out of chaiactcr."" Sho never has used a modern word or expression and he illustrated the seeming significance of this by pointing out how difficult it would be for a man trained In Irish or negro dialect to make a 30 minute talk without breaking out of the character. ""She has nothing lo tell, in my opinion, ""Reedy said, ""but she com mands my admiration and reverence. She tells nothing- that we have not heard from tho old masters and bards."" ""What of the divinity of Christ?"" Kcody at one time asked her through the ouijd board. She answered, ""He bought thee of his loving."" ""What of love?"" he asked. ""Tho love there is but tho o'er drip of lovo here"" came the respouc of tho board. ""Describe tho place where you are?"" sho was asked. ""Think you ""Patience Worth,"" Mythical Character, Startles Literary World With Her Quaint I English In Essays, Plays and H Novels Noted Writers Are H Puzzled Over the Output of H This Woman Supposed to H Have i Lived 300 Years Ago H there Is bottom or top; this is a walless country.""

""Patience may be a second person ality of Mrs. Curran,"" -Reedy sato. ""but she teaches a lovo that is greater than we can conceive and that death is the keeper of unknown redemption."" LITTLE COLONIAL DAME. Mrs. Emily Hutchings, who -was one of the first to receive 'with Mrs. Curran the messages from Patlenco Worth, said the first glimmering or the quaint personality of the little Colonial dame came in the maxim: ""A busy saw gathereth no rust."" One of the sentiments expressed by Patience Worth is: ""A blighted bud may hold a sweeter message than the lovllest flower; for God hath kissed her wounded heart and left a promise there."" Of the seances, Mrs. Curran says: ""I sit with a friend, our hands up on the board, which I havo come to believe is nothing more than a con centrator. There is no trance. Ev erything is quiet with the exception of Patience Worth. The only definite part is that while I put my thoughts awhither, as Patience would Bay, and immediately the sto ries, poems, plays., parables, or whatever her work for the sitting IH may be, is shown to mo in tiny pic- JH lures, beautiful and distinct a3 IH though my eyes saw them.

SIX years ago Mrs. John H Curran, of St. Louis, a peculiarly healthy-minded, normal young woman, who is the wife of the former Immigration Commis sioner of Misitvouri, began for amusement to experiment with the ouija board. This peculiar instrument for receiv ing meaaages foom the beyond"" consists of a flat wooden board, about two feet long by one and a half wide, on which are th? letters of the alphabet, the numerala up to ten and the words ''Yea,"" ""Mo,"" ""Don't know"" and ""Good-by."" A little heart-shaped table on three legs is placed on top of the board. The sitters place the board upon their knees, the finger tips of both hands lightly upon the heart-shaped table. After a while an ""influence,"" ""apirit"" or ""spook"" begins to move the heart-shaped board, whose narrow end then points to the letters, spell ing out the words of ?ta* message. A third person, an observer, acts as amenuensis, taking down the letters as the pointer indicates them. The ""mestages"" are accounted for by non-spiritualista as an expression of the sub-conscious self of one or both of the sitters; the mysterious movement of the table is supposed to be due to unconscious muscle rhythms of the hands of the sitters. Whatever the explanation, Mrs. Curran began to hear from someone who signed herself ""Patience Worth"" and who spelled out upon the board sentences in remarkable English?archaic, a forgotten dialect. This ghostly per sonage speedily developed into the strongest kind of a personality. She had been, she wrote, a maiden of Dor setshire. England, who lived about 1650. She was a weaver's daughter, an only child. She wrote that ""my thumb is thick from twisting flax"" and speaks of deliver ing fine linen to the ""castle folk."" Her father left to come to America, and after the death of her mother. Patience says she followed him to the new world. ?She was then thirty-five. Her new home was in the vicinity of Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket. Near there she tv a? buried, and now, she says, ""a tree grows out of my grave."" Soon she began to dictate stories and poems with ex traordinary rapidity and facility. The first book pub lished was ""Patience Worth."" The ""Sorry Tale,"" a story based on the episode of the impenitent thief on Ihe cross, came out in 1916 and ""Hope Trueblood."" the last book, was a story of old England. The remarkable literary excellence of these writings attracted widespread attention. Their dialect passed every teat of experts. It was proven that Mrs. Curran had no previous knowledge of them, nor had she the education displayed by the com munications. Dr. Martin F. Prince, the famous neurologist, diagnosed Patience ""asa sub-conscious personality of Mrs. Curran and offered to rid her of it by hypnotism. Mrs. Curran refused to have ""Patience"" banished by this means or any other, and scoffs at the sub conscious theory. Other distinguished scientists studied her case, but with no better results. For three years the ""ghost"" of Patience Worth?or whatever it is that responda to that nam?2?had been dic tating to Mrs. Curran by means of the oirija board as a concentrator. One book had been printed, another waa on the way to the printer. The first book was already promising an excellent sale. Reviews had been flattering and the publie was becoming interested Then one evening, after the Currans had been' dis cussing this materialistically agreeable result of the.man ifestations, Patience Worth exploded a bombshell. In the quaint old English words which she uses she an nounced that inasmuch an there ""seemed to be some money in sight."" and since it did not belong to the Cur rans. ""but to God,"" that they should seek ""a wee babe that had nothing, nothing and take it and care for iti"" This was. indeed, disconcerting. The Curran house was a well-filled one. There was a grandfather, a mother in-law, a stepdaughter and the husband and wife. Be sides, they had counted upon using the money for thorn selves. Patience, however, was determined and explicit. Sho caustically called attention to the fact that the emolu menta of her bock did not belong to those who simply took down her dictation, but that as the author and main spring of the volume the returns from it were hers to do with aa she Dleased. ""I am a weaver of cloth,"" said Patience on that night, in the curious imagery she loves to use, ""and this cloth weave is not for him who hath. Thou ehalt seek a wee one who hath naught, and thou shalt deliver the goods of me unto it? hands, and ye shalt speak ita name ?Patience Worth.""* This was an order, not a request 1 And to it when the first shock of surprise had worn off the Currans gladly bowed. ??L?ook ye.'' the '^heat** went on, ""this shall be one who is sorely in need, mind ye Ye ?hall whisper sweets unto it. even unto the wee ear that knoweth not thy words, and tell unto it of a fairy dame who shall minister unto it and of Him who sent her And she shell be the love of all who love me and shall smile sweeta unto them.*' ""But why a girl instead of a boyt"" the Currans aaked anxiously. ""Ye aee,'* answered Patience cryptically enough, ""a man laddie hath man'? cunning, but the wee dame??ah, I know I"" The Curran? quite naturally asked about the parent age of the child, ita legitimacy and many other important things, not the least of which was a description of it so that they might know when they bad found tbe babe Patience had in mind She gave them certain directions???rather vague; told them ""not to mind earth's law but God's""?referring unquestionably to the matter of parentage and to watch close if there were any blood taints, but not to go back further than the grandparent?.. She wanted the child dressed simply, she concluded, and asked thai ""about its neck thou ?halt hang a sign of Him."" The Curran?, and rightly it, turned out later, construed this to mean cross."" ""Ye shall be upon tbe path! E'en now the wee one is waiting,"" she urged. So the hunt began for a child who wouid answer the description. The entire ""Patience Worth"" clan was sent out on the seareh. Two physicians were selected to ex amine it when found for blood taint! Much ground wa? covered in the next month. There were handicaps?an interesting one the refusal by a certain large St. Louis foundling institution to allow any baby to be taken from there because ""Mrs. Curran wrote on a ouija board."" During this search ""Patience,"" who seems to have a strange sense of humor at times, remained silent. Then one night, according to Mrs. Curran, she directed them to cease, telling them there was no use in looking for ""one that was not whole,"" and that in due time certain signs would be given them whereby they would know what to do adding that if they did continue it would be ""like a wolf seeking for a fat fowl to feed well upon when the bird was still in the egg."" After this, other weeks passed by without any reference being made by ""Patience Worth"" to the matter. Then one morning Mrs. Curran met an old friend whom she had not seen for years, and in the course of a ride together told some of the details of the quest for the baby. The friend, in return, told of a young wife who was about to become a mother, who was practically home less and friendless, and whose husband had been killed some time before in a mill accident. That night g mes sage from ""Patience Worth"" indicated that at last the Curraros were on the right track and that which she had prophesied M'as about to occur. The next day Mrs. Curran went to see this woman, who was very ill. A fever of preparation began imme diately. Layette cradle, perambulator, lawyers, adoption papers?everything was made ready just as though the thing were already settled. Seemingly the possibility that the expected child might be a boy was never for a moment considered. The mother-to-be signed the adoption papers, but held them under the agreement that if she lived she was to keep the expected child, but that if she died, then the Currans were to have the baby. Six weeks later, as Mrs Curran was writing with ""Patience"" upon the now well-known ""Sorry Tale,"" the ""ghost"" stopped the dictation at exactly nine o'clock. ""This be enough,"" she wrote, and the board became quiet. Everyone was on tip-toe with expectation. It had been arranged that they should be called by phone at ten o'clock for news of the birth, which had been imminent for some hours. On the hour the telephone rang and word came that a girl child had been, bom at exactly the moment when ""Patience"" had stopped the writing When the child was seen it had all the marks that were expected. Its hair was red as ""Patience Worth"" had described her own. It had blue eyes with dark lines in them, like those which -""Patience"" had said she pos sessed when on earth. Its parentage was the same as ""Patience,"" whose father, she had said, was English and whose mother was Scotch. The baby's mother died four days later and the child was legally adopted by the Currans acting for ""Patience Worth She was christened as Patience Worth Wee Curran on November 26, 1916, the Rev George Wales King, a prominent St. Louis minister, officiatine?.

Whether there is truth in a statmmnt that the ouija board is adding patients to Wasinta asums through disturbing infinenoes augon District mentalitin, students of mental phenomena will be inteAsted in the fact that the board takes its name from the French word oui (yes) and the German word ja (yes). Its origin is somewhat obscure. Both the planohette and ouija, somewhat simila in appearanes, date back to about 1855, and for a while were objects of consider able superstition. The planchette is a small board fitted with a pencil and two casters, made to move easily over a sheet of paper when the hands rest lightly on it. The dictionary says the ouija ""is a form of planchatte used in spiritualistic seaness or the like. It consists of two parts, a board containing the al phabet and other characters, and a planehette, with a pointer substituted for the pencil."" Investigation of automatic writings fail to find that the two boards have any origin in the mysticisms of Egypt. One writer is of the opinion that the iret at tempt in ouijaing was made by a man on his wife's breadboard. The skeptical refer to the board as wholly a modem trick afair which has no connection with Eastern or other metaphysics. Some of the noted spiritualists of the world make use of the ouija or planchette and carefully study the results. An able group of psychologists regard the ouija as a dangerous deception. Their theory is that the subconscious mind of the operator directs the fingers in such a way as to convey the information hoped for. The operator, they hold, is as innocent of this subconscious process as a sleep-walker is of what, he is doing, and naturally puts a supernatural con struction on the outcome. Leading spiritualists and other believers in higher agencies than natural ones, confident that communica tion with the other world is not only established but is developing into an understanding that will glorify humanity, are willing to accept the ouija board or any other method of transmission that will add ti the in formation they feel they now possess. Those of ma terial minds, who deride all supernatural beliefs and theories, hold to the opinion that after every great war there is a wave of the occult in some form, and say that right now the ouija board happens to be the g most popular man-made medium of bringing together terrestrial pinds and celestial beings and thoughts.",No timeline found

The racquet has a slender handle and a blade with a frame about one-half inch thick, which Is cov ered on both sides with thin drumhead Material.

""Love"" and ""advantage"" as topics of social conversation have now a ping-pong significance entirely foreign to their for xtx-r meaning among the capital gossips. The ping-pong party has entirely sup planted the whist party arid the bridge circle.

This -may be regarded as gross exagger ation. It is a potent fact, however, that ping p has attained a surprising vogue ■among Washington's public men. All the leading hotels and cafes are hastening to open up ping-pong parlors on their premises, so that their distin guished patrons may indulge .to their heart's content in the game. Senator Maur.a. when asked the other' ■day whether he favored the. erection of aj ping-pong parlor in the national capital, l>uckercd up.his brow* and gave the mat tor a few minutes' serious consideration before discussing the idea with a smile. Congressman Sulzer, when asked to ex plain the tremendous hold that ping-pong has taken upon members of the-house, said that it is a wonderful game for~ex erclse. and gives one a good hand to sustain the handshaking proclivities of the vast army of well meaning citizens who swoop down upon unwilling repre sentatives of the people with all the re lentless energy of the notorious New Jersey musquito upon its helpless victim. As may be supposed, the stores have not been slow to take advantage of the commercial possibilities of the craze. In -addition to the fact that some of the larger dry goods emporiums are opening up ping-pong saloons for the accommo dation of their patrons, the new game has an important bearing upon the latest styles.

Doom of the Tight Corset. One important reform the game prom, ises to effect, which may render rational, the development which has been lavished' upon it by England and America and im mortalize the new game as one of the most valuable and beneficent reform fac tors of the century. Ping-pong may abolish the tight laced ■corset. Ping-pong is essentially an informal game to be played at the spur of the moment, as the whim seizes. It is a game to be introduced by the smiling hostess after the last vestige of the din ""■ner has been cleared away and ti;o white table cloth is removed to make way for the ping-pong net. Consequently as the rapid movement and freedom of body S necessary to me ping-pong player renders the corset impossible, the charm ing diner out has either to leave off her corsets when she dresses to attend a modern dim party or run the risk of having to stand against the wall in ail the-prim symmetry of a corseted waist and, watch the merry movements of her more fortunate sisters who, with grace fully swing forms, keep the merry cellu loid ball ping-ponging across the table at a lively pace to the intense admira tion of the man with the racquet on th^ other side of the table and .every other man In the room. v This good may ping-pong do; bu other wise what peculiar qualities has the same to '-rive it phenomenal popularity? Strict ly speaking it is nothing more or less then a table adaptation of lawn tennis and tennis, while possessing to an equal and even greater degree the same physi cal benefits and sporting fascinations of its replica has never attained the vogue which has been vouchsafed to ping-pong. Played on Dining Table. Ping-pong is played on an ordinary din- Ing table and its only accessories are posts tp hold the net, the net itself vellum string or wood-racquets and cellu- loid balls: The game is for two people one standing on one end of the table, the other opposite. The player who first delivers the ball is called the server The Other the striker out. i The service is strictly underhand and is delivered from beyond the end of the table. The: ball served must drop on the table beyond the net and is then in piav. if it dops into the net or off the table it counts to the striker out The server wins a stroke if the striker out fails to return the service or ball in play of the table. The striker out wins a stroke If the server fails to return the ball in play or makes a foul in service. On either player winning his first stroke the score la 15. The second stroke brings the score to 30; the third stroke is called •40 and the fourth stroke wins a game The player who wins the first six games -wins a set.- This is all there really is to the game of ping-pong.

Ratification of the federal amendment by the Ne braska legislature made that measure the eighteent amendment to the fed eral constitution. All but a half dozen of the forty eight states are expected to adopt the amendment in the next few weeks, but the action of Nebraska today gives the ratification of thre-fourths of the states, the number necessary to ad minister John Barleycorn the k. o. punch. One year from today every saloon, brewery, distillery and wine press in the land must close its doors unless as now seems likely, they are already closed at that time by war prohibi tion, which goes into effect next July 1, and stays until completion of de mobilization. The amendment which outlaws li quor in this country reads: Section 1. After one year from the ratification of this article, the manu facture, sale or transportation of In toxicating liquor within, the importa tion thereof into, or the exportation thereof from the United States and all territories subject to the jurisdiction thereof for beverage purposes are hereby prohibited. Section 2. The congress and sev eral states have the concurrent power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation. Section 3. The article Rhall.be in operative unless it shall have been rat ified as an amendment to the consti tution by the legislature of the sev eral states as provided by the con stitution within seven years of the date of submission thereof to the states by Congress. This is the amendment adopted by Congress December 18, 1917, and rati fied by thirty-six states a little more than a year later. And these are some of the things that the amendment will do: Wipe out a stroke 236 distilleries; 992 breweries and over 300,000 saloons and wholesale liquor establishments, forcing thir employes to seek other jobs. Cut off from these persons annual incomes totalling more than $70,000, 000 in pre-war times. Cut off from the United States treas ury a source of taxation counted upon for an even billion dollars in their first drafts in the new revenue bill and millions in additional income to state treasuries. Remove the liquor question from na tional, ate and city pontics for all times and help increase city, state and federal expense by decreasing law violations. The fight on liquor, triumphant to day is as old as the constitution it self. It raised its head early In the nine teenth century and was looked upon as another crank notion. But it gathered strength. Churches took it up, doctors followed and then came the organization of anti-liquor societies, the anti-saloon league an1 others. In the middle of the ninteenth cen tury Maine went dry. Kansas fol lowed. At the end of the Civil War the little Wind of anfi-slave agitators, who had won their fight, seriously considered turning to the prohibition battle. Their number included Wil liam Lloyd Garrison and Poet Whit tier.

Ten years later the crusade against liquor had grown from the ravings of cranks Snto an irresistable move ment that swept the country. But John Barleycorn will try to stage a come back. Distillers are already planning a fight on the amendment in the courts on the ground that it was not adopted by two-thirds of the whole Congress and that the seven years limitalon in it invalidates the measure. The drys say they are confident that neither of these contentions will hold and on their side are preparing legis lation carrying heavy penalties for prohibition.

Those familiar with the affairs of this State realize that tho coming Legislature is practically committed fo a prohibition amendment, but Its action will toe heralded broadcast by the Prohibitionists that Kentucky is anxious to go into the dry column and is more than half way ready to adopt the constitutional amend ment as submitted by Congress and tho Senate.

One consoling thought to the people of this State will be that this legislation marks the passing of the hypocrites and fakers who have made Frankfort their headquarters at every legislative session. The usual figure-heads of this clan are the down-and-out country preach ers who; not able to secure a church or congregation, use prohibi tion as their means of making a livelihood. They are assisted by tho narrow-minded fanatics who are insane on the subject, and last but not least the wily politician, who uses the Anti-saloon Leaguers and the Prohibitionists to further his political ends. Kentucky has been cursed with prohibition politics for tho past sev eral years and it will toe a relief to have tho question settled by the people. There has hardly been a Democratic political convention or primary that Haly and Beckham have not held the bugaboq prohibi tion up to control the party, and good men have been driven from active service because they could not seo their way clear to ,hark back to tho days of Salem wlth craft and Puritan fanaticism.

A six-year race to make this a bone-dry country was set going to-day, when the Senate by a vote of ?i to 20 decided tt submit a national prohibition amendment to the states. This amendment must be ratified by three-fourths of the states within six years after it has been sub-: mitted. Tho six-year period w-,11 not begin until the House of Representatives has also passed by a two-thirds majority the re.jolutior., but that this will be done is not doubted by the most en thusiastic wets. The highest hope of the wets now to stave off the vote :n the House until next session. The House has until the expiration of the present Congre??, on March I, lJl>, to pass the amendment, so to nullify to days action in the Senate the wets would have to stave off a vote in the House until after that date. Senators said o-night that this is the first time in the countrys history that a constitutional amendment. hns ever had a time limit string to it. Thirty six states. the necessary three-fourths to ratify a constitutional amendment, must have approved the bone-dry amendment within six years following the date the resolution is flnally passed by both houses or it will fall to th grcund. If, six years after the House nas passed the amendment adopted by the Senate to-dav, only thirty-tive or fewer states shali have approved it, all the work done in getting the resolution through I ongress and in getting those thirty-nve legislatures to ratify it will be lost. Flght To Be Transferrcd So the passage of the resolution bv the House, which is eonceded to be coraing, whethei this session or next, will transfer the flght of the pro- hibition forces to the state legi?- iatures. The real battle will lie in a tew states. It is probable, for in stanre that but little atten.ion will be wasfd on such states as New York and \?w Jersey. The drys virtualiy have twcnty-flve sure states states which nrf now bone dry or nearly so, Bt that they will only have to make an upbill battle in eleven additional states to ratify the amendment. Ono or the bijrgr?t surprises of the day was not he vote on the final adoption of the amendment, though this was much larger than expected, but the vote on r.n amendment by Sen? ator Nevlar.ils. This would have made the prohibition against -distilled liquors, insiead of intoxicating liquors, and would have saved light wines and beer. It was defcated, 67 I to 22. Hy practically tha same vote tho Senate refused to adopt a plan of Sen Bttl Pnelan, of California, which would have given the state legislatures the right to pass either on a bone dry amendn ent, or one prohibiting mereiy diatilled liquors. Senator Stone, of Missouri, one of the prnnouncvl opponents of prohibi? tion, trtatod the Scm.t BBd fralleries to another surpr.se. Waiting until the clerk was reading the list of how the Senators had voted. he \oted for the r.m.endment. At once his col!eag-je, Senator Reed. another pronouneed anti prohibitioni-t, rushed to his desk. After a hurried confab, he stood up and addressed the Chair. He voted no. This does not rcprcsent a conversion on Mr. Stones part, but mereiy his idea hat the states should have the right to determine the question.","August 1, 1917 : The Senate passes a resolution to present a constitutional amendment prohibiting the sale or consumption of alcohol to the states for ratification."

I am going to furnish you and the country exact and indisputable facts concerning the enforcement and operation of the prohibition law in Kansas. The proof which I shall submit to you would be accepted as conclusive evidence before any court in the United States. I am anxious to know whether the good people of Chicago are willing to credit the statemn ;s of a combination of brewers and saloonkeepers who are spending hundred? of thousands of dollars annually to poison public opinion, and debauch t^e iaw in preference to the statements of those who are standing up for : 1, American home, working and pleading for decency in public life and making effo; ; in every direction to build up a great state on the foundation of a wholesome morality. I did not come here as a politician, for I have never yet had either the time or the inclination to iearn the laws or tricks of scientific politics. 1 have never made a prohibition speech in my life. I am a practical, plain- speaking business man and while I regard the moral and sentimental sides of the question as constituting its strongest claim on society for support I propose, to a very large extent, to discuss the subject from a cold-blooded, economic standpoint. In other words, I am going to present it to you as a sound business proposition. When I was a candidate for governor in 1908 I made the campaign for my nomination and election on the proposition that if elected to this office every saloon, joint and place of every kind whatever regardless of the sentiment of the community had to be closed. This proposition was made in my campaign speeches to the saloon men in wet communities as well as to temperance people; I stated publicly all over Kansas — in Pittsburg in the mining districts as well as the localities where the law was enforced — that any man who estab- lished himself in the saloon business in violation of the laws and constitution of Kansas would be regarded the same as any other outlaw, and all the power and force of the state government would be used to punish and destroy his business. This does not mean that we have no violations of the prohibitory law, for if there were no violations such a law would not be necessary. It does mean that the prohibitory law in Kansas is as well enforced as other criminal statutes, and that when men violate it they are arrested, convicted and promptly sent to prison. The United States government has taken a step which will aid materially in stamping out the irresponsible bootlegger and whiskey vender who now is the principal violator of the prohibitory law in Kansas. Under direction of President Taft the Attorney General of the United States has ordered United States district attorneys in dry territory not to compromise with men who violate the internal revenue laws by permitting them to pay fines, but to prose- cute them and send them to jail for a reasonable time. I want to especially impress the fact upon your mind that while Kansas had substantial prohibition for twenty-eight years it has had absolute prohibition only since May, 1909. Previous to this time liquor was allowed to be sold through licensed pharmacists, for medicinal, mechanical and scientific purposes. Abuse of this privilege led to dissatisfaction and the last legislature wiped out all exceptions and made the state absolutely dry. Before they could sell intoxicating liquors these pharmacists had to obtain an internal revenue stamp and it is upon this circumstance in part that the agents and spokesmen of the breweries and the distilleries are trying to deceive you by showing the number of so-called licenses issued in Kansas last year. A further explanation of the number of licenses issued in Kansas is found in the method of handling violators of the Federal stamp law. When our state officers arrest a man for selling liquor they notify the internal revenue officers, who come to him at once and collect a Federal license tax, often times finding the man in jail. This man is then quoted by the breweries, distilleries and sa- loon men of other- states as a saloonkeeper in Kansas, when in fact he is either in jail, paroled during good behavior, or under injunction never to again engage in liquor selling in our state. Under our state law the finding of a Federal license stamp in a place fitted up for the sale of intoxicating liquors is primae facie evidence of violation of the prohibitory law, and I challenge the brewers and distillers to show one in- ternal revenue liquor stamp posted in a saloon or joint in Kansas. While I am not an expert in the affairs of the local government of Chicago I venture the assertion that conditions which are due largely to the saloon and kindred evils of society constitute your most disturbing and distracting prob- lems. Usually cities having an ambition to solve such problems commission delegations of its wisest and best citizens to investigate the treatment of these problems by other communities. As chief executive of my state it would give me great pleasure to welcome delegations from Chicago to Kansas for the purpose of showing them the results of prohibition. We have had commis- sioners from Canada, New Zealand, England and Australia and even now the governments of Italy and Russia are investigating our methods of dealing with this evil, the greatest social and governmental problem on the face of the earth today. If wisdom should cause you to send such a delegation to Kansas I will guarantee they will not find a business man of standing in the state who will not testify that prohibition is the best business asset of Kansas. Prohibition must be judged by results — it must stand or fall upon its merits. The people of Kansas are very progressive, very positive and intensely practical in their ideas and habits. If the prohibitory law had not given us a better civilization and a higher type of manhood and womanhood it would have been repealed years ago. If it has increased drunkenness, crime and perjury, as saloon men claim it has done, the saloonkeepers would all be supporting the law instead of fighting it, for it would increase their revenue. This is .an age of conservation. Prohibiting the manufacture and sale of whiskey is more closely identified with a sound conservation policy than are the laws prohibiting the wanton destruction of the forests.","January 17, 1920 : Legal enforcement begins"

https://guides.loc.gov/chronicling-america-prohibition,https://www.loc.gov/item/09023500/,1,"THE LEGAL ASPECT OF PROHIBITION. JOHN CLEMENS BENTON. The prohibition movement grows apace. Indeed, it may be said, at last, to have attained the dignity of a national question. True, Congress has not as yet under- taken to legislate on the subject; and in fact, it has no power to do so &in so far as the general public is con- cerned& if the provisions of a seemingly obsolescent Con- stitution are of any force and effect whatever. True, also, that both of the great political parties continue to ignore the movement in their platforms. Nevertheless, ir many sections of the country it constitutes the most important local issue, and in all sections it is a more or less engrossing topic of political discussion. Already prohibitory liquor laws obtain in many States and communities, and, if we can credit current statistics, forty per cent, of the people of the United States chafe under their iniquitous and exasperating re- strictions. And, notwithstanding legal fictions to the con- trary, these laws do, in fact, deprive persons of property without due process of law; they do, in fact, impair the obligations of contracts, and they do, in fact, deprive the people of vested rights contrary to the letter and spirit of the Constitution. Moreover, they impede the growth and commerce of individual communities, thereby im- pairing the general prosperity of the Nation; they se- riously cripple the national revenue, and they tend to revolutionize the accepted theory of constitutional gov- ernment. For these reasons the question may be considered national, and, perhaps, the most important national ques- tion at present confronting the American people; the one of all others now pending most directly affecting the rights and- liberties of the people, and one upon the","January 17, 1920 : Legal enforcement begins"

At least the preliminaries havo been arranged for inaugurating tho ""roller skating craze"" in Honolulu, The Honolulu Skating Ilink Com pany hag been organized bv a number of young men. of whom Clifford Kim ball is the business representative. A skating boom has been in tho air for somo timo and this ontcrpriso is its culmination, Having taken the Union Feed Co.'s old warehouse at (jucen and Edinburgh streets for u rink, tho company will open it to the public on Saturday evening, March 3. Lumber is already on tho ground for tho skating floor. A supply of skates is on tho wny. They are or steel with ball bearings in fact the type of skate in uso on the Coast and in the roller skating rinks of New York and Boston. On tho inauka siilo of the building tho walls are to be opened up for admitting the cool breezes. This will make for comfort in tho exhilarating sport. A lean-to on tho Waikiki sido will bo fitted up. as a ftr.injlaf nnrl. aiu uvMrtfofn.. fliAvn a ""Slsofjto be' a jiodnwator booth on the premises, but ,no spirituous, malt or a vinous liquor will bo sold. Arc lights will bo -installed, which will make the rink always brilliant. Of course an admission feo will be charged, as well as a skating feo. The riuk will be run on a first-class basis, in ehnrgo of a competent man. It is believed by the promoters that tho time for starling bucu a place of amusement is opportune. For a long period there has been' a dearth of popular entertainment other than theatricals and field Bports. To tho younger generation of Honolulu folks up to twenty-five years of age skating will ba an absolute novelty, for it is twenty years since tho previous voguo of that amusement here. And thero Is undoubtedly a larger population of tlnW hankering after that class of diversion, combining"" exorcise with rollicking fun, In Honolulu now than then. The craze will bo a pastimo, moreover, for ninny onlookers of tho large class who take enjoyment from seeing others making joyful. At suitable intervals there will bo masked or fancy dress carnivals held for tho jollification of tho town. In the former craze theso wero highly successful features, No doubt Bandmaster Bcrgcr will meet me craze iiuiiwiiy aim uo prepared wmi ijn special stunts of music for gala",1906: The craze works its way into rural areas of the western United States. More roller skating rinks open in major cities along the Pacific coast and Hawaii.

In a sort of speechless ocstacy., Round and round and round thslr bodies swaying this way and that in a strange rhythmic motion. Round and round and round— sometimes faltering, staggering, clutching frantically at thin air. from fatigue or excess of emo tion, no doubt. Round and round and round— sometimes suddenly falling with a crash or a thump —according to the meagerness or ampli tude of the structure of the beings—mo mentarily overcome by exhaustion or fervor perhaps; then struggling to their feet again with wild gestures and frantic efforts, unheeded by the speeding throng. Devil-driven can they be, these madly hurrying, swiftly gliding beings? Round and round and round— urged ever onward when their spirits seem to flag and their limbs to las by the intoxicating plinky-planky-plunk of the piano that must be devil-played, even as the beings are devil-firlven. for no visible fingers press the keys that are uncannily lifting up and dropping down, striking the notes to which the hurrying throng; keep time.

As I sit at one side, alone, upon a chair, among the tiers of empty chairs, alone and unheeded by the speeding throng that iaoks never to the right nor the left, but ever Into some dim beyond. I note that the"" came beings flash past my vision again and again, -on an endless, :#mle33 journey, some steadily like the planets ir: their orbits, others spasmodically dash ing In and out among the rest. In erratic course like comets. I note, too, that when indeed brtngs that have become familiar drop out, new beings appear and the throng hurries on. ever on and on and on, without diminu tion of members or of speed. Round and round and round they go youths and maidens clasping hands and swaying in unison; youths and maidens gliding singly and seemingly unconscious of each other; youths and maidens pursu ing each other, overtaking and capturing each other without losing one single rhythmic beat of the curious gliding mo tion. Roi:nd and round and round they go the beings of middle life, male and fe male, finely, with arms crossed behind then or hands thrust deep into their pockets, lost In meditation or the deli rious joy of motion; fla pairs, supporting each other In the onward struggle, mak ing mighty effort and but small and tor tuous progress. Round and round and round they go— even. the aged, the patriarchal males with ba!d her ?s or white beards, the females stout but determined, or those luckier' ones whose gray locks and wrinkles must be marked to belle the slendcrness of their waists. Round and round anG round they go— and darting In and out among them, with waving arms and legs and a port of stud led malice in their movements, are these imps .sent' to iotment them, to lmp«-de prnjrress and endanger limb and life, to afflict them and make their penance more real, or are they, indeed, as an extraor^ dinary indulgence and toleration would fee-em to indicate, mercy the young of Ihtir kind the exub«rar»i. undisciplined male young?

What Is there in roller skating that makes its victims willing to endure the agonies of the Beginners' Pen? One can understand the perseverance of the boy in the' sweater who slides and joggles and spraddles .and sprawls his unruly way from one end of it to the other, for in strenuoslty is joy for the bor kind. But the stouV and studious Individual, professional by his spectacles and soft white hand 3. sedentary by his rotundity— what is there in this latest, maddest fad"" that sets him to struggling with those fiendish little wheels that snatch his feet from under him. that bump him. Into wall and pillar and fence, that set him to wav ing his -arms like a windmill gone mad. that plump him flat upon the floor with an impact that jars his teeth In their sockets? What Is there in it that inveigles the matron out of her dignity into slipping and; sliding about on costers, clutching at men and women without the formality of an Introduction, remember whom she would scorn to put on her visiting list? Whatever it is. it's a very potent charm, for from its first dtvotees— the merely young and giddy and unclassified— lt has spreaJ until there is no safety in age or rank. From their first neadquarters,/ at the large and necessarily democratic Me chanics' Pavilion, they have overflowed until there's a rink in every quarter. Society, of course, cannot be democratic long, and having fallen victim to the fad, it soon organized itself into a club that ei: joyed the privileges of the Pavilion without the intrusion of the mob one nisrht every week. It was the Monday Night Club, with a membership of 500. and a list of patronesses that included the names of the undisputed leaders— Mrs. Kleanor Martin, for instance: Mr& Dow ney Harvey, Mrs. Walter Hobart, Mre. James Follia.. The club was organized foi but four nights' skating, but so splen didly did the finances and the enthusiasm hold cut that its skating extended over nine nights, and it has disbanded reluc tantly oaly at the approach of Lent. So potent is its charm that it has be guiled not only the most unexpected victims into skating, but hard-headed business men into investing their money in leases, rink floors and skates. The pavilion is frankly democratic, advertising its masked skating carni vals unbiushlngly with prizes for ""a fat ladles* race,"" ""most comic lady's cos tume"" and ""most comic gent's costume."" So. quite naturally. In the face of this there has sprung up a new and exclu sive rink on Pacific avenue. In the old armory, that was once upon a time in its history a riding school for fashion also. Here all sweaters and never show-dirt shirts are to be barred; no ""fat ladles* races"" are to be contested: no ""genta"" are to be on the list of eli gibles. It is to be small and highly select, and already its list of patrons reads like a chapter from the Blue Book. Jewish society has made for itself quite the most exclusive \u25a0 and hand somest skatlnfe rink in the city by turn ing the spacious, lofty, well lighted, beautifully floored ballroom of the Concordia Club from its original pur pose. There the 'club members practice of mornings"" with skilled instructors, and there they have a ladies' night once a week that is as well attended as tha smartest dance or swcllest wedding. Quite as naturally rinks sprang up or are about to. spring up in the Mission, in the Richmond district, south of Market and— where do you think this last one Is? on' the Barbary Coast! Yes, even those freebooters of the night life are abandoning the waltz and the two-step -33 they practice it and are taking to the little wheels and going round and round and round with the rest of the World, fashionable and otherwise. CfcJK \u25a0 What greater proof can there be of the lure of the roller skate when in this territory, already famous for its skates, the denizens take to the new kind! Billy, the laundryman. came to the res ""Some green hand in his establishment made an awful mlxup and bits of the Van Slcklen wearing apparel were dis tributed throughout the community wher© they would do the most good. The dilapi dated condition of moat of the articles re joiced the hearts of the recipients. Bord well drew a dress shirt and a union suit which he says he would have been ashamed to send to a rummage sale. ""Every piece was plainly marked ""Van S..' so that there was no doubtabout It. Several returned their finds directly^to tha owners, and one aggressive lady aug-; gested a Joint note of sympathy and offe""r of pecuniary assistance. ""It was evidently -most distressing to the aristocracy, and Bordwell avers: that the 'For Rent* sign now upon the Van Slcklen bouse \u25a0is the direct result. "";Ha says that Billy's talent is certainly mar velous, and in spite of; the laundryman's protestations, he Insists that it was a. beautifully worked out ""plan from begin ning to end. as Billy acknowledges that the Van Sicklens .were three months be-, hind on his books. VBordwell says this la not the v only -.proof 'of Billy's genius. Some months ago the two had an argument over, prices, s and the next weok .Bordwell's pajamas came home' starchetl as stiff as .frozen flsh. Billy almost wept tears of contrition over 'the incident, but Bordwell thinks it 1 was a case of getting back at him just the same. He says \u25a0 there is .no end of such opportunities in the laundry business, and the wonder is that more men ol hl*h abil ities don't so lato KIT Fit",November 1906: Newspapers begin running stories covering fashions related to the craze.

They are SBS B •_« placing themselves on an equality with WOW O mei^ in all way«, and, hs men are sup posed, never to be guilty of such weak ness, women also must imitate this stoicism and develop hardness or Htrong-minded- QeM, whichever we may choose to call it. It is very questionable if this is good for women in any way; it is a relief to shed tears, and many a nun would be glad if it were not regarded as CowardiM for him to weep. It is Nature's meth od, or one of her methods, of assuaging grief, and the inability to indulge in tears leads many men to drink as a means of giving vent to their feel ings. .'._ From another point of view, however, this stoi cism is certainly prejudicial;. that is, in the chances of marriage. Whatever men may say, it is inherent in them to like a tender woman; they tte in her one who will sympathize with them, and who will come to them for sympathy.' No man really likes to see a woman cry, for it hurts K irn and makes him uncomfortable until he can do something to relieve ,but all men prefer a woman who can and does cry. Not a foolish, faint-hearted specimen of humanity, who flops down at any trouble, however small, but really a tender-hearted creature who, although brave' enough, does not try to encase herself in a kind of additional outer skin, or suit of mail, that will render her proof against sentiment.

KSECq Another hygienic and beauty-wooing diversion has been added to her list of indoor winter sports, roller skating; before which throngs of enthusiasts willingly bow. And mcthiukn that morning tennis and croquet clubs, which were so fashionable last winter, will now go a-begging. This whirling through the air is a most invigo rating form of exercise, keeping the body in a good, steady motion (that is, after you have gone through the preliminary stages of proper balan cing, when your physical and mental forces some times woefully desert you). The exercise brings all the muscles of the body into play, stretching those the average woman seldom employs, besides stimulating the blood into healthy, vitalizing action. Not one woman in ten takes the proper amount of exercise; yet she wonders why she easily tire*, why her complexion is dull and colorless and her circulation poor and languid. Here's her beauty balm, packed down and running over. The benefits of ukating are materially increased when the fair whirler will make up her mind to take deep, full breaths, such a* can only be ac complished when the shoulders are thrown back and client out, in place of the atingy, little in halations that utterly ignore the upper portions of the lungs. ROLLER SKATING ABROAD. Heir, then, is au ideal exercise, that will keep you in good physical trim until the outing season intervenes. Let me conclude thin overture set ting forth the manifold benefits of roller skating by saying that Madame Heavyweight and her oliiu, aimeinir little sister will i-.ich deiive physi cal battarOMDt particularly suited to their indi vidual woe». We Americans are faddists at best with regard to our pleasures. T.OS ANGELES HERALD SUNDAY SUPPLEMENT We take hold of a new diversion, run it to death in six months, shelve it and take up an other. With the present advent of roller skating, however, it is likely that it will make good for a considerably longer time. In foreign capitals, London, Paris, Vienna and Berlin, roller skating is regarded quite as essen tial an amusement as theatres and music halls, and here the rinks are never closed except in midsummer. The costuming is usually elaborate, often fanci> ful, and the scene as a whole, a very picturesque and interesting spectacle. .mere is a wide difference between the charac teristic types of the skaters of the two countries; the sturdy, blonde-haired (Jerinun fruulein, and the dninty Parisian, with her perfect coiffure and chic toilette, are good example* of whut 1 mean. Fancy dress costumes, bal masques, as Paris calls them, are frequent occurrences, and many of these are given, both in private rinks, rented especially for the occasion, and in the large pub lic rinks. All manner of fancy skating is intro duced, and in some cases national dances are given on roller skates. In London, while the King, Queen Alexandra and Princes* Victoria do not actually indulge in the merry sport, they often occupy a private box on gali occasions, and saem to thoroughly en joy the merry spectacle. Pauline Chase, the original Pink Pajama Uirl, hat recently introduced a very novel skate dance in Ixindon that is making a great hit. But how boon, here in America, are we going to introduce our foreign cousin*' idea of a carni val on roller skates? Here's a chance for a wide awake manager! <\KH ACCORDING TO HOUR OK lUY The Americau girl, as ever, has adopted l>rue i,,il and becoming attire for this indoor *p«rt that i.i in perfect taste for the- hour of day or uight. For the morning sessions the fair skater is very simply gowned in a rather severe tailored suit, with morning skirt of plaited linen or dainty ba liste, or fine French flannel, both styles being frequently hand embroidered. In place of the separate* waist, which is more practical and comfortable on account of its light weight, a waist is worn to match the skirt, mak ing a three-piece suit. The waist may be of the same material, or of silk trimmed with the cloth, r more fashionable combination this winter. The flannel waist referred to is not unpleasantly heavy, as it is the same quality used for outing wear in the summer. White or cream serge skirt worn with lingerie waist make* v pretty and attractive costume. The skirt and waist, too, may be kept in the locker or in care of the wardrobe woman and left there for a small sum each week. Roller skating seems to have captivated soci ety people. Especially in the morning do the girls make the largest showing, since there is less to do on the social program, and a string of automobile* and carriage* is always along the curb at thia hour of the day. GAY COSTUMES FOR AFTERNOON AND EVENING. Quite a stunning array of gown* is seen in the afternoon, many of which are typical matinee toilette*; short skirts, of course. A number of dressy bodices are worn, white or those in pale shades, harmonizing with the skirt*. A mlk or ahiffon blouse will top off a skirt of plain cloth or figured cloth. Many fetching plaid suits are worn, and in place of the small turban hats, larger one* are worn in the afternoon, laden with flowers, grape* and feather*. The surplice and fumpar with tfuimpes of lingerie, silk or shiffon! Mry attractive. Prime** and piiBMM corselet gowns aie worn for afternoon and evening, developed in a quan tity of fashionable materials. At night the scene presented is brilliant; white,< pale and brilliant colors are worn, and the gown ing is often quite elaborate. A favorite style for evening wear is a silk or velvet Dutch dress (which is a princess, cut with low neck and shoulder straps), worn over a frivolous little guimpe of some sort, chiffon, lace or silk. A striking model of this description was worn the other evening; a wine-colored dress, panne velvet, ""with self-colored chiffon guimpe, trimmed with bands of passementerie and silver buttons and a large cream felt hat with wine-red plumes shaded to pink. Another was of black corduroy, princess corse let (low) with bretelles of black velvet and baby Irish crochet waist over pale blue chiffon. The hat was a ""magpie"" model, narrow brim of cha mois-colored felt and crush crown of pale blue vel vet caught at the side with small black plumes and rhinestone buckle. I describe these costumes to show you how the fittingly well-dressed women choose their rai ment for hours of the day. CONFIDENTIAL VIEWS ON THE SIDE. Since Paris has taken up the no-corset notion, 1 1 see girls experimenting with the fad during the morning, and undoubtedly the unrestrained exer cise will do them much good, but the same girls have small waist* in the evening. Feminine vani ty is a stronger force than self-preservation. Girl* who have long, narrow feet should choose shoes with wide, extended soles, otherwise the skates will not stay on, and when they slip off the soles a very nasty fall is sure to follow. For a 3tt-A shoe, a number 8 pair of skate* is re Short »kift| should be worn, those that touch or nearly 10, are too long aud are likely to throw you. U y° u have a pair ot bloomers, us this doe* aw »y wilh e*t«'a skirU, save the O i,g which makes your effort in skating mv.li easier aud you fuel several pounds lighter on your feet. MAKJOKIi;: Why One Actress Has Not Wed Y~"" 01) ash. iv.ii i have never married?"" queried a ""star"" of the theatrical nim _ ament, when frankly asked her reason for escaping Hymen's bonds.

Probably those figures are not ap proached in any other city in the world. Europe cannot equal them anywhere, and surely our smaller cities and towns do not pay so oeariy tor tne cnuaisn pastime. But it Is worth wnile for fathers and mothers everywhere to take care when their little folk Indulge their fancy for the sport; and if they do not bar out the level spots they can stand guard over the graves A day or so ago when three little tots were seen speeding and coasting about on skates that fairly skipped over the giound. some passersby were heard to remark that there would be some broken heads or shattered bones before many days went by If that racing kept up much longer. The only reply was ""Non sense,"" and as no direful reports have been heard presumably all has gone well with the loung racers, but tnose ios deaths In one great cit.

Just as nolslli or as quietly as they like Infnlr to Children. Few, very few of our cities, are fair to the children.

Their boys and girls can play In the open, and can keep off the busy streets, but of those 10b children killed while roller skating, most of them skated and played In the thick of traffic because they had no play space of their own and no big place where they could go.

Washington. Feb. 3.—The provi sion authorizing an income tax as now i?nnen.?nP£rtknown .of the federal constitu­ tion will be as the ""Sixteenth Amendment"" and reads as follows: Article XVI.—The congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source de- w'"",ou' apportionment among the states, and without regard to any census or enumeration."" The change in the fundamental la'V or the land marks a new epoch in the American tax system. For the first, time congress is given specific authori ty by a provision of the federal con stitution to levy an income tax. All previous efforts for a tax of this kind have been without the explicit author ity of a constitutional provision. Tho change also marks a broad develop ment of the economic and fiscal s.vs torn of the a basis for taxation, simi lar to the systems now in force in Great Britain, Austria, Switzerland, Spain and various other countries. New Source of Revenue. Probably the most important aspect of an income tax. as now authorized by the constitution, is that it adds a new source of revenue for the govern ment. At present the two great sources of government revenue aro customs duties levied by tariff acts on goods imported from foreign coun tries and internal revenue taxes on tobacco, spirits, olemargarlne and cer tain other articles. Each of these sources at present produces a little less than half of the total revenues of the government. In 1911 the total government revenues were $700,100, 906 and of this customs duties yielded $11.3,846,269, while internal revenue' taxes yielded $331,759,375. The re mainder came from sales of public lands, the corporation tax and various miscellaneous sources. Under an in come tax, however, a new and far reaching source of revenue ls provid ed for the government, and this will in turn reduce the amounts required rfom the other sources of revenue,' customs and internal revenue, in or der to meet the expenses of govern ment. This last phase is likely to have an important bearing on tariff legis lation as hereafter enacted. Before the amendment formally be comes a part of the constitution to. day's action of the legislature must be transmitted to the secretary of state at Washington and proclamation of the ratification made. First Step In 1909. The first official step toward amend ing the constitution so as to authorise specifically an income tax was taken by the senate on July 7. 1909. By unanimous vote, that body adopted a resolution, submitting this amend ment to the legislatures of the respec tive states. Only a few days later, on July 12, the house passed the resolu tion by a vote of 317 to 14.",1909-1913: State legislatures across the U.S. begin to ratify the amendment.

The Sixteenth Amendment to the constitution of the United States has been ratified by the legislatures of thirty eight states, two more than the required three-fourths. It gives Congress the power ""to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several states, and with out regard to any census or enumeration."" Congress having been given this power what is its duty We believe that it should at once proceed to pass an income tax law, Some argue that no such duty devolves upon Congress that the amendment simply gives congress the power to act but that it does not follow that it should act at once as present conditions do not demand such action and the provision is solely for the purpose of giving congress the power to pass a law when the necessity shall arise. As viewed in the light of history, is this argument good We think not. The Sixteenth Amendment is the only amendment to the constitution in forty three years. In 1893 Congress passed an income tax law which the Supreme Court held unconstitutional. For this reason those favoring an income tax law proposed amend ing the constitution. Finally in 1909 both houses of Congress by a three-fourths vote passed the proposed amendment and now three fourths of the states by their legislatures have ratified it. Since a few years after the close of the Civil War, there has been practically as much need for an income tax at one time as another. The members of Congress believed that the people wanted this law or- they never would have passed the amendment, as most of them were voting to impose a tax upon their own incomes. The members of the state legislatures that ratified it also thought that the people wanted it or they would not have voted for it, because it is not the type of measure that is passed by a legislature against the wishes of the people. The people believe that an income tax is fair and just and Con gress should pass one at once. We can see no reason why one should not be passed. It is only right that the people who are re ceiving the largest benefits from government should pay for keep ing it up that those who can best afford to pay for maintaining the government should do so. A person's income is the best gauge of his ability to pay. An income tax it is hoped and believed will take some of the burden of the support and maintenance of the govern ment off of the shoulders of the poor and put it on the shoulders of the rich, where we believe it belongs. But it's opponents says that it will make a nation of liars. If a man will lie about his income to prevent paying a tax on it, he is already lying about how much property he has to prevent paying a tax on it. It is not making a liar out of him, because he was already one. It's opponents also say that it will be unjust, as incomes derived from certain sources are much more definitely determined than from others that the man on a salary will almost certainly pay","February 3, 1913: Wyoming becomes the last of the three-fourths states needed to ratify the Sixteenth Amendment, which officially enables Congress to legally act on a permanent income tax."

Some idea of the extent of the pub-lic sentiment is shown by the fact tbat the New York World has been able to report subscriptions of over $30,000 in a month's time, in sums averaging less than $1"" each, the great bulk of these contributions being in dimes and quarters.

It will stand as a grand symbol of liberty be-fore the eyes of every one coiaiug frol l the oppressed countries beyond the ocean.

Liberty Enlightening the World. This now Wonder of the World, which is now being loaded on the French transport lsere for shipment to this country, is tho largest statue in tho world. Somo idea of its magni tude may bo obtained from tho fact that 40 persons found standing room within the head. A six-foot man standing on tho level of tho lip3 only just reached the eyebrow. Whilo workmen wero employed on the crown of her head they seemed to bo making a huge sugar caldron, and they jumped with caso in and out tho tip of tho nose. Fifteen pcoplo might sit round tho flame of tho torch, which elevation can bo reached by a spiral staircase within tho outstretched arm. Tho London Daily Ncics, in speaking of it, says It is out aud away the largest statue of modern times. Tho Colossus of Rhodes was nothing to it. It could carry tho 'Bavaria' or tho 'Hermann' in its arms. It towers to tho skies from tho yard of the Ruo do Chazelles, whoro it has been eight years in construction, and tho view from its coronet sweeps clear of the six-story hbuses and beyond tho walls of Paris."" Tho weight of this stupendous statuo is 440, 000 pounds, of which 170,000 pounds are cop per and tho remainder wrought-iron. It is expected to arrivo in New York about the 25th of May, whero it will bo erected ou Bedloe's Island, this being the location selected for it by Gen. W. T.

When placed in position it will loom up 305 feot above tide water, tho hight of tho statuo being 151.2 feet, that of tho pedestal 91 feet, aud foundation 52.10 feet. This imposing statue, higher than tho enor mous towers of the great Brooklyn Bridge or the steeple of Trinity Church, which is tho loftiest in tho city of New York, higher, in fact, than any of tho colossal statues of anti quity by its rare artistic proportions, as well as by its stupendous dimensions, will add an other to tho Wonders of the World. A word should bo said of its artistic ""merit.

Laboulaye, the founder of the French-American Union, first definitively broached his patriotic project of building in this country a joint memorial of the struggles of the French and Americans in the Revolution, and sent the young sculptor Bartholdi to the United States to find, if possible, some suitable and happy idea.The first suggestion of the statue, perhaps, dates still further back to a dinner given under the Empire by M.

Nowadays both men and women may be found who daily make It a duty to exercise for a certain length of time with a common, everyday barrel. Corpulent people may now rejoice, for this latest acquisition to the catalogue of health and figure improvement methods has been proven to do everything claimed for it. Thin, sickly people may also join th* chorus, for it not only reduces flesh with fleshy individuals, but makes flesh atd muscle. Improves the breathing apparatus, invigorates the action of the heart and brings about a graceful carriage. All the properties needed consist of ,a small barrel or keg. The exercise may be taken in a bedroom, although out of doors is better. Barrel-rolling, like all other kinds of exercise, must be taken In regulated! doses. The man who goes at It like ha woulJ to a fire will realize little real bene fit He will derive the greatest who makes it a business as well as a pleas ure, begins on a small scale and works up to his greatest capacity gradually and naturally. The exercises given in the following are prepared especially for those who are earnest erough to have a try with this new method and who will be really con- scientious in their work. For the first exercise the barrel Is laid on the floor on its rolling surface.' The body should be so arranged that only the tips of the fingers and the palms of the hands touch the floor, the greater weight of the body ing borne by the keg. The body should then be propelled forward, the hands being used for that, purpose. The legs and arms must be kept as rigid 'as possible, and the feet must not be moved until the barrel, moving naturally downward, reaches the knee. Now re verse the movement, pushing backward with the hands until the barrel is rolled up to the arms. This exercise should be repeated several times. It is the most important of all for reducing the weight, although It tends equally with the fol lowing, others to develop the arms, broaden the chest and make the abdom inal muscles flexible. The second exercise Is practically the reverse of the.first. Rest with the back en the cask this time. Place the arms downward, and rest the heels on the floor —the heels only, mind; no other part of the legs. In order to get the barrel in motion, move the arms alternately as far forward as possible. The cask will then reach the heels, the body being raised from the floor. As before, reverse this movement and ""bring the cask up to the small of the back, still taking care to keep the legs stretched out straight. ""While performing this exercise, keep the lungs well filled, the stomach drawn in and the chest expanded. When the keg is up to the part of the back referred to lift th* arms from the floor and extend them along the side of the body.* with open palms on hip. Keep this position as long 1 as possible without strain. The third exercise is a pretty one. It la performed by lying with the left side of the body, just above the hip, resting 'on the"" barrel. If you wonder why, in the picture, the right hand is upraised, you will know as soon as you begin the exer cise. vlt is to balance the body, for the feet qnly touch the floor. ""With your left hand pull your body forward as far as possible until the feet can be raised from the floor. This is not as easy as it looks, but a little perseverance will manage it. Then move back to the former position. .When this exercise has been fairly well jnnEtered, repeat it. but by lying on the richt side of the body and holding the hft hand in the air. This exercise is liable \to strain the body if it is perse vered In with too much zeal, and care should, therefore, be taken to be conser vative. The fourth movement consists of lying with the back on the cask, the arms, at first, folded. This, while appearing to be similar to exercise number two, is quite rent, for here the feet only are U3ed to force the body over the barrel until the latter has reached the shoulders anl back of the head, when the arms are then placed at the side, as in the illustration. As in the second exercise, do not neglect, while in this position, to keep the stom ach drawn in and the chest expanded. No person with a weak back should prac tice this movement, for the strain upon the neck is rather severe, and an acci dent might be attended with unpleasant consequences. The fifth is a fine exercise, easy, grace ful and at the same time beneficial. Stand straight up, with the feet together, stom ach in. chest out, shoulders square, and head back. Place the small barrel first upon the toes. Bend down and grasp hold of it. and bring it, not too quickly, up to the waist line and thence above the head. Hold it there for a second or two, being sure that your figure is perfectly straight. !V A good method of regulating the breath ing apparatus, the functions of which are rather severely drawn upon in this exer cise, is to count, one, two, three, four, etc., at each swing-up of the cask, and inhale air through the nostrils only at the even numbers, two, four, six, and so on. The sixth exercise follows naturally from the fifth. Raise the cask from the toes to the chin line, still keeping the body rigid, though the legs may bo stretched a trifle apart, to preserve the equilibrium, and swing the barrel to the right and the left alternately. Follow the same rules about breathing as in the preceding movement. The next exercise, the seventh, is one which can be done expertly only by the man who has Indulged in this form of barrel-rolling exercise for some time, but so many parts of the body are brought into play during It that nothing should be neglected to bring one's salf to the pitch of necessary ability. Stretch the legs so that the feet are apart about twenty-four inches. Then swing the bar rel down briskly between the legs and Tiigh up over the head, bending the back and allowing the knees to bend slightly forward as the barrel passes under the body. Go slowly about this exercise, for It is, as has been intimated, no small strain over the whole of the body, and it is not one to be performed by the weakling. Yet the weakling can easily get to it by prac ticing the previous exercises. It is a matter only of degree. Keep the lungs partly filled as you exhale, because it la neceesary to use the thoracic and ab dominal muscles, for the Improvement of which this exercise has been partly de signed. The cask ls placed In a novel position for the eighth exercise—as far a? the body Is concerned. That Is. one must re cline upon it stretched lengthwise in the tame direction as the body. Place th? hands on the floor In front and let the toes, the tips of which touch the ground, support your legs. Now roll from left to right, or the bar rel from right to left, according to the way of looking at It. Refrain from be coming too enthusiastic at this pastime, or the barrel will slip away from under you and you may flatten your face against the surface of the floor or ground.","August 31, 1902: The latest exercise fad comes in the form of barrel rolling—using a barrel for fitness purposes."

Take a deep breath, rsieiug your chest hign, and walk about yoxir room on tiptoe; hold the breath for a few neconds, eipel, take another, hold, expel; and bo walk about the apartment until you are quite tired. Be sure to keep your arms stretched high above your head. When it possible to do thia exercise during the day besides morning and night, so much the better. EXERCISE V. Lie on the floor or on a very hard couch; for in this exercise there must be no yielding under the body. Take a deep inhalation through the nose, raising the abdomen as you do so. Then still holding the breath, force the chest upwards, letting the abdomen down. Repeat movements, and exhale through your nose while the chest is raised. Practice until capable of doing move ments five times without letting your breath out, abdomen nnd chest up alternately. EXERCISE VI.

Girls are no longer afraid of being strong and ruddy They are beginning to thoroughly understand that good health is not the pre rogative of one sex, and that good health can only Be preserved by exercise. It is true that all girls cannot exercise as they should. Some are so situated that ev ery hour from sunrise to sunset has its duties, each one confining; others inherit ailments that prevent walking or running, and a few perhaps are restrained by false ideas oi dtcorum from developing their frames by ex ercise. But the majority remain in a state of ill health simply because they will not ex ercise, or do not know how to set about it. Perhaps many do not know what exercise really is. A carriage ride is not exercise, neither is housework nor any exacting labor, no matter how hard it may be. II that were bo, the blacksmith would be the most long lived of men; but statistics prove otherwise. Gymnastics are not always exercise in the true sense. No pennnncnt good can come of ¦winging clubs or dumb bells in a close room, unless followed by a brisk walk and a bath. Croquet is exercise, and lawn tennis is best of all. But. neither •of these games is beneficial if played for fashion's sake. The girl who gets herself up in a ""stun ning"" costume and plays for the effect on the spectators, might as well be reading a novel in the parlor. Loose clothing, com mon sense shoes and an ardent desire to win tin 1 game, are the requirements for exercise. Mowing is another capita] exercise for girls, if they can overcome their natural timidity; and swimming is better sitll. It is not gen erally known that girls swim more gracefully than boys and learn quicker. Both these ex ercises have an additional value in the fact 'that they may some time preserve life. Pitching quoits is beneficial exercise, and trains the eye and hand. Badminton, a vari ation of the old game of battledore and shut tle-cock, is a game which forces all the muscles of the legs and arms into action, nml puts the players into a glow of pleasura ble excitement. Where good roads abound, cycling is an exercise timt is beneficial, if not carried to excess. No girl should attempt to ride more than twenty miles a day: to ride more is re ducing exercise to work. It is injurious to try to pee how far or fast you can go in a given time. Take it moderately and you will ?ever tire of your wheel. Lastly comes walking, and I think that is the ben( exercise of all. •It is the simplest of all exercises, yet there are some rules to be observed if you would get the greatest bnefit. The best time to walk is before nine in the morning or after five in the after noon. Begin with a mile walk every morn ing or evening and increase the length until you can cover ten miles a day? Walk in the country if possible; if that is impracticable, choose wide streets, those nneci with trees preferred. Mind how you walk. Square your shoulders, expand your chest, and hold your head high. Keep the mouth closed when not talking, and breathe through the nose. Step out easily and firmly, letting the ball of the foot strike the ground first. Vary the location of the walk each day if possible, and exercise the ere and mind as well as the body. Never let the walk become a drudgery. When you return home take a Rponge bath, a vigorous rubbing, a cool gown, a glass of milk and a nap. If you do not feel healthy, happy and wise after a month of this exer cise, you may be sure that yoii have some chronic disease. In summing up, remember that all exer cise, to be beneficial, must be taken in the open air. You may amuse yourself over a billiard table or a game of cards, or you may have a lovely time in a ball room, but you cannpt develop your form or add an ounce to your weight unless you breathe fresh air. The simplest exercise in the open air will do you more good than the most elaborate gym naßtics""in a closed room. You must also bear \p mind that exercise must be continuous to be beneficial. Once you get yourself in good condition, you must keep there by constant exercise. Do not look upon this as a task: with in creaaing strength the exercise will be a posi tive pleasure, which you will not think of shirking. You will be proud of your ability, arid your ambition will grow with your achievements. Try it for one year, and see if I am not a true prophet.","July 28, 1907: Exercise is recommended for girls because nowadays girls should be “strong and ruddy,” whereas before they were expected to be “frail” and “delicate.”"

Bring up the forearms against l the chest until they stand vertically, the edges of the palms forward, the lingers straight and pointed upward. Thrust the arms upward straight above the head.

The difficult part of this exer cise Is to bring the backs of the fingers against each other, while they meet on top of the head, at the same time forc ing the elbows back. When you have learned to do this, forcing the elbows back Into tje same plane as the body, then It will be good for you to hold the position for several seconds. You will feel your chest forced forward under the strain. To return, separate the hands, turning the finger tips outward, and let the arms describe a graceful circle to the sides again. A very old exercise, one used by laborers to keep warm as well as by women to round their shoulders, Is simply swing the arms back and forth outstretched, bringing the palms to gether behind you as high as you can make them reach. A splendid shoulder exercise Is this: Raise the arms laterally, palms up. until they are at shoulder level. Keep ing them outstretched, describe circles with them, holding the palms always up and never letting the arms pass In front of the line of the breast. Raise the elbows laterally to shoul der level, letting the fingers rest light ly upon the chest. Throw the arms back until each entire arm Is out stretched laterally, palms forward. You must force them In such a way that you can feel the chest pressed forward. Raise the chest at the same time. Let the arms fall at the sides. Raise them laterally until the elbows are at shoulder level, the finger tips resting upon the shoulder, then let them fall to the sides again.

However, in so far as Uncle amrn's place in the racer for aeronautle pres tige s concerned the situation bids fair to present a repetition of the history of the development of the submarine boat as an engine of warfare. It will be remembered that when, after cen turies of impracticable attempts, an American, John P. Holland, blazed the path to the modern dependable under water cruiser a number of European nations, notably France and E0ngland, grew excited over the subject and in augurated acitlvities in the field that bade fair to cast the United Stator. completely In the shadow.

And just here It should he added that Uncle Sam in making up his aerial fleet is confining himself to the products of the American inventors of aeroplanes. This is not due to any billy., unreasoning patriotism, either for Uncle Sam is always out for the best-but to a sincere conviction, clinched by tests, that our home products are very much the best in the aeroplane line.

The War Department was kept, busy early in February declining all sorts of offers from aviators. It seems as if every man in tins country who either owns an aeroplane, or expects to do so, during the past few days has of fered to patrol the Mexican border for the War Department. If the services of every aviator who volunteered had been accepted the heavens along the Mexican border would soon be tilled with ncroplatii! or the ground in that vicinity strewn with the wrecks of flying machines. Very wisely the War Department decided to put this matter entirely under the supervision of Lieu tenant i.xF. Foulois, who Is at San A 1 1 1 1 . 1 1 i i with the only aeroplane own ed by the government. It is under stood 'that the State Department, as well as the War Department, feared that a large force of civilian aviators on the border might involve this gov ernment in International complications with Mexico. Unless the aviators were under the command of Lieutenant Foulois they would bo very apt to fly ovit Into .Mexico. There they might lie captur ed n spies, and it would be very dif ficult for tins government to extend to them the protection which Is nsked by every American citizen who gets into trouble in a foreign land.

Need after need to secure automatic equilibration and stability of the flying machine in its unstable path is being discovered and met by men of the genius and cool-headed daring of the Wrights, Curtiss, Harmon, Hamilton, Paulhan, Farman, B16riot. Two things are evident,?that mechanical flight will be made safe and practical, and that the personnel of the sterling qualities necessary for reduction to practical utility is available. What, then, are the prospective uses of aviation? The paramount immediate use in times of peace is sport; but soon, even in times of peace, commuters will travel back and forth from suburban homes to large centers of population by aeroplane. The time that can be saved, and the sport coupled with business in such travel, will recommend its wide adoption. Cleared alighting areas or wide cleared avenues will radiate from large cities in all directions, over which aeroplanes may pass back and forth, with always a place for safe landing underneath, should anything go wrong. Since man first swung a club in combat, warfare has commandeered every invention it could utilize, and often a little lead of one people or tribe over another in some implement of war has meant victory for its possessor. Therefore, we naturally inquire of Mars what uses he holds in prospect for the flying machine. We have recently had demonstrations of the ability of the aeroplane to drop bombs on warships, coast fortifications, and cities, and we have also had our sham battles.

Hon. Charles Stewart Rolls, third son of Lord Llangattock, and noted for I his recent double flight across the English channel, was killed at Bourne mouth, England, at the aviation meet, In which Armstrong Drexel so distin guished himself several days ago. The tragedy occurred in the pres ence of n great company of specta tors, a majority of whom were women and children, and many of the per sonal friends of the young aviator. The Wright biplane on which he was flying fell suddenly with terrific speed from a height of 100 feet. It struck the ground close to the crowded grand I stand, smashed Into a tangled mass, ! and before the doctors and their as ! sistants could reach the spot Rolls was dead. The event in which Rolls was com peting was for a prize for the aviator alighting nearest a given mark. The goal was directly in front of the grand 1 stand, where the spectators were massed. He had risen to a good height and then shut off his motor and was gliding in a broad circle toward the ! mark. Without warning the tail piece of the biplane snapped off. The machine gave a sudden lurch, and the frame work crumpled up in the air. When It struck the ground it was smashed to splinters. The doctors found that Rolls had sustained a fractured skull. The wreck of the machine and twisted stays surrounded the body so that there was difficulty in extricating the unfortunate man.

Windows on three sides and a skylight help to make the room cheerful, which he says adds greatly to the effect. In one corner is a small skeleton chair which he calls his yoga chair. It is straight-backed and would prove anything but comfortable for library use, but there is little chance of anyone letting his attention wander so far afield while sitting in it that he would fall asleep, in any sense of the term. For this reason, the chair is all the more valuable for the practice of yoga. Seated on this chair or standing, the practitioner goes through thirty minutes of concentrated mental and muscular exercises every morning and afternoon. These exercises consist largely of assuming more or less strained postures and in regulating the breath. Standing straight as a soldier on parade, Mr. Dulin illustrated the exercises. Placing one hand over his right nostril, he drew in slowly a deep breath through his left nostril, rising on his toes as he did so. When he had filled his whole lungs, he closed the left nostril too and still on tiptoe held his breath for about thirty seconds. Then, opening his right nostril, he exhaled slowly. This exercise is repeated seven times, and then the breath is drawn in through the right nostril and exhaled through the left. Another exercise consists of rising on the toes and at the same time placing the outstretched arms above the head with hands clasped and also drawing a deep breath, which is held for a number of seconds. Still other breathing exercises are taken while sitting on the yoga chair. Breathing Affects Mental Activity.""I drive each breath into every part of my body or into such part as my will designates,"" said Mr. Dulin. ""My attention is concentrated directly upon what I am doing. The motion of the lungs has a very intimate relation to the activity of the mind. If we control the motion of the lungs, the activity of the mind comes more easily under control. Conversely, if we control the activity of the mind, we can also control the motion of the lungs. When the motion of the lungs is brought under perfect control, every organ of the body is brought under the control of the spirit. Have you ever noticed that at the time of perfect concentration of mind the rhythm of respiration changes and gradually becomes slower and slower; perhaps it will almost cease for the time being. It has been said by a clever and experienced thinker, Dr. Lewes, that to acquire the power of attention is to learn to make our mental adjustments alternate with the rhythmic movements of respiration. How intimately breathing is connected with life is apparent to anyone who stops to think of the so-called phenomena of living. As soon as breath ceases, the very body itself disintegrates. When supreme control over attention is acquired by voluntary effort, it is possible to fix one's attention on any part of the body and experience strange sensations and wonderful phenomena. It is a well-known fact that one can easily experience pain in any part of the body by merely fixing the attention upon that part. By an analogous process, one can get rid of pain in the body. Mental healers, many of whom surround their practices with all manner of mysticism, are familiar with such phenomena, although they fail to understand the true inwardness of their cures. One can cure disease by fixing attention on the diseased part and sending an opposite current of thought. This method has become a common practice with Christian Science healers, and other mental healers under a variety of names. But one thing should be remembered in this connection. It is that each individual is born with this kind of healing power himself or herself. No one can give you that power. It is one of the natural powers of the human mind. It is far better to heal yourself than to go to some other person for a cure, which, at best, is only temporary. Do not let your mind be controlled by any other mind. Men and women who go to mental healers or Christian Scientists for help and who allow themselves to be influenced by the minds of others, do not realize that, by allowing themselves to fall under the hypnotic power of stronger minds, they are walking in a path which leads to mental degeneration. Many cases have been known where minds have degenerated into the slaves of other minds, losing all power of self-control. How pitiable is the mental condition of these self-deluded ones. ""Because a yogi comprehends this danger he never allows himself to be influenced by the minds of others. And for the same reason he is careful about attempting a cure of his fellow-beings. While through perfect concentration it is possible to cure an ill person other than himself the yogi rarely attempts this, knowing the danger to which he is submitting his patient. Vedanta teaches the power which is latent in every human being for self-cure. We do, however, at times, and have done so in extreme cases such as fever. I could reduce a high fever by means of the power of concentration.""But if yoga is rightly practiced it should prove a preventive rather than a cure for disease. Anyone who is practicing yoga daily should be in perfect health. It gives immunity from disease. Since I have practiced yoga I have never been ill for a moment. It hardens the physical body to such an extent that it can combat with ease the so-called germs of disease. What are germs? Anyway but the creation of the human mind? The invention of a human mind would be willing to eat all the bacteria you bring me and feel no evil effect.""""If that is the case and the whole human race should take up the practice of yoga the average age of man would be greatly advanced, would it not?"" Mr. Dulin was asked.""Undoubtedly,"" replied he. ""The effect of yoga upon longevity is marked. Man should live to be 125 years old."" Mr. Dulin has picked the age which the Russian scientist, Metchnikoff, selected for the average length of life of man. According to the Russian, however, man can attain this great age by living largely on buttermilk and a wonderful bacillus discovered by himself. Four Divisions of Yoga. There are four grand divisions of yoga, and each division is suited to a different tendency of mind. The first division of yoga is called Karma Yoga. It is for the active man, for those who like to work, the busy everyday workers in mankind. It is largely the science of physical culture. By this means the true science of physical culture is reached. depends upon the concentration of the mind upon work in hand as well as the mere going through with certain exercises. Karma Yoga teaches the secret of work, and shows how to turn the daily tasks into acts of worship. Thus man may reach perfection of life through work and work alone. Bhakti Yoga is the name given to the second division. It is for such as are of an emotional nature. It teaches how ordinary emotions may bring forth a spiritual unfoldment of the highest kind and lead to the ultimate ideal of all religions. It explains the nature of divine love. The third division is Raja Yoga, which has to do with the whole realm of psychic phenomena. By its psychic powers are developed such as have astonished the world since the beginning of history, and which have been termed miracles by the uninitiated. This division includes the evolving of the fine perceptions, the projection out of the body of the power of life, the curing of disease, and all the physical powers displayed by Jesus, and are in use by the Christian Scientists today. These phenomena have been known and understood by the yogis of India since ancient times. While Raja Yoga teaches all these psychic powers, it does not fail to warn its students that they are not the end of wisdom nor a sign of spirituality. ""Little brains and weak intellects easily turn away from the path of spiritual truth when some psychic power begins to manifest itself,"" said Mr. Dulin. ""They think they have reached the highest state of spirituality because they have the power of curing a headache."" Jnana Yoga is the fourth division or method. It is for the intellectual discriminative and philosophical man. Value of Yoga in Business. ""Of what tremendous value Yoga proves to business men can readily be understood aside from its spiritual value,"" continued Mr. Dulin. ""In these days of competition it is the man who can concentrate upon his work and perform it, shutting out all other interests, who goes to the front most rapidly. The practice of Yoga demands concentration and Concentration before everything. The habit of concentration grows greater as the practice of yoga continues. For example, I can today accomplish in a few hours what would have a few years ago required several days of hard work. Vedanta explains the true basis of ethics. Why should we be moral? Not because it is written in a certain chapter of a certain Scripture, but because of the spiritual oneness of the universe. When you realize that you are part and parcel of the whole creation, you know that if you injure others, you injure yourself, and no one gains anything to himself under such a belief. Vedanta believes that for the time being, at least, this is for his good. No criminal commits a crime without thinking that he is to benefit thereby. Vedanta shows that because of this same spiritual oneness, we should love our neighbors as ourselves since in spirit we are already one. ""Thirst for enjoyment is the real disease in us. Its various symptoms are passions, ambition, pride, jealousy, hatred, anger, and all the rest. Tremendous mental exertion of will power is often necessary to control the restless mind from taking the forms of waves of passion and anger. Perfect self-control of a yogi is that state of mind in which no desires or passions of any kind disturb the peace and tranquility of his soul. Such a state of mind can be acquired more easily by removing the bubbles of desires before they take the form of passion; that is, by attacking them while they are in their incipiency. By concentration and meditation upon the supreme truths, the desires may be brought under complete control."" Vedanta teaches that the soul never dies, that the soul of each individual man is part of the divine power usually termed God. It teaches also that the soul of man will return to this earth in various incarnations, which represent the different stages of advance toward that perfection of being which is the true goal. Mr. Dulin said that the practice of yoga is materially aided by a vegetarian diet.",No timeline found

It is a weird religion, that of the Yogi, known in its generic form, but, in its many mysterious ramifications, regarded in awesome ignorance. That these fakirs do perform some wonders that not seem altogether inexplicable less, is attested by numerous reputable witnesses. But the power behind all this is still a mystery, clothed in the limitless shroud of occultism that only the East Indian can employ. To the Caucasian, the self-abnegation required to arrive at the perfect point that the Yogi assumes seems an impossibility of attainment. The marvelous concentration of will, it is said, makes the human brain capable of accomplishments. Yet the Yogi claims that they have gained mastery over this indomitable will forever, and, in this mastery, lies the power which enables them to govern natural laws, even to the intangible law of gravitation. This power, which is in constant play, gives them control over the force of creation, the beginning of all being, and indeed, is a part of this faith. They believe that when man has gained his first purified form, and cast aside all grossness, he will return again to his original state. Belief of the Yogi The circle of existence runs unending and upon it rests the truth of all material and spiritual life. It is believed, therefore, that when their self-imposed trials of abnegation are performed stoically, they have gained their end, and are united in all respects to the Supreme Being, whom they worship. The main object of the Yogi is to establish a doctrine of a Supreme Being, and to teach the means by which the human soul may become permanently united with it. This Supreme Being is the reputed founder of the system, defined as a particular spirit who is untouched by affections, works the result of whose desires, in whom the germ of omnipotence reaches its supreme limit, and who is the preceptor of even the first because he is not limited by time. His appellation is Om. To attain the consciousness which leads to union of the soul with the Supreme Being, eight stages are taught. These are: moral and religious rectification, posture regulation of the breath, restraint, fixation, and profound contemplation. Self-Control and Religion. The first stage, self-control, consists in not doing injury to living beings, veracity, avoidance of theft, chastity, and non-acceptance of gifts. The second stage, religious observance, comprises external, as well as internal purity, contentment, austerity, muttering of the Vedic hymns, and devoted reliance on the Supreme Being. The third stage of Yoga, postures of various sorts, is regarded as essential to those following. The fourth stage, regulation of the breath, is three-fold, according as it concerns exhalation and inhalation, or becomes tantamount to the suspension of the breath. The fifth stage, the strength of the senses, means the diversion or withdrawal of the senses from their respective objects, and their entire accommodation to the nature of the mind. This stage is preparatory to the sixth, or the steadying of the mind, which means the freeing of the mind from any sensual disturbance by fixing the thoughts upon some part of the body, usually the tip of the nose. Meditation and Contemplation. Meditation, the seventh stage, is the fixing of the mind on the one object of knowledge, the Supreme Being, to the exclusion of all other thoughts. The eighth, or last stage, profound contemplation, is the perfect absorption of thought into the object, the Supreme Being; it is devoid of all thoughts and meditations. In such a state, a Yogi is insensible to heat and cold, to pleasure and pain; he has the same prosperity and adversity; he amends in ascetic reduction. The last three stages are generalized again, because upon their perfection depend the wonderful results which are promised to those who apply them to the extreme. Such results are, for example, the knowledge of the past and future, the knowledge of the sounds of all creatures, the knowledge of what has happened in one's former births, of the thoughts of others, and the length of the human frame; the power of levitation, the overcoming of hunger and thirst, death at will, and the creation of all that exists in the different worlds; and an analysis of the structure of one's own body. Their Eight Great Powers. There are eight great powers which a Yogi will accomplish when properly regulating his knowledge—the power of shrinking into the form of the minutest atom, of becoming extremely light, of becoming extremely heavy, of unlimited reach of the organs, of irresistible will, of obtaining perfect dominion over everything, of changing the course of nature, and, lastly, of going anywhere at will. If the Yogi apply his knowledge to the contemplation of the smallest division of time and the successive order in which such divisions occur, he makes a discrimination which enables him to understand the subtle elements and to pass into the infinite. When his intellect has become free from passion he knows neither friend nor enemy, and no longer is subject to the result of acts performed, and when both have thus obtained the same degree of purity, the Yogi obtains eternal liberation. This is the religion that Mrs. Stead has adopted. But enough of technicalities. In practical demonstrations the Yogis have made their faith stand the world’s amazement. And their demonstrations are of remarkable puzzles and marvels. The existence of God, as realized by them, is a matter of absolute demonstration—the forbidden fruit of the perfect man, and an element of life itself, as is oft witnessed frequently by foreigners. Yogi named Govinda-Swami, on the terrace of his own house. Being by no means credulous, Jacolliot took every precaution to prevent deception. Fine sand was strewn on the ground in order to make as even a surface as possible. The justice was asked to seat himself at a table, upon which was a pencil and paper. The fakir carefully laid a piece of wood upon the sand, and announced that whatever figures Jacolliot might draw on the paper would be transcribed precisely upon the sand by the piece of wood. The Yogi stretched out his hand, and the wooden piece immediately copied upon the sand the most complicated and twisted figures that Jacolliot drew. When the Frenchman stopped writing, the piece of wood also came to a standstill. Read Words in His Mind. The fakir stood at a distance against a wall, while the justice held the paper and pencil in such a way that the Indian could not possibly see what he was writing. Finally, the Indian asked Jacolliot to think of some words in Sanskrit, whereupon the piece of wood instantly traced n the sand the very words that were in the justice's mind. The fakir next stretched out his hand toward a huge bronze vase, filled with water, and weighing several hundred pounds. In five minutes the vase began to move, approaching the fakir with a slow, regular motion. When the distance between the vase and the paper had been considerably diminished, the vase began to emit loud, metallic sounds, as if struck with an iron rod. Occasionally, the noise would resemble the roar of a fire. At Jacolliot's request, the fakir made the vase stop, move, and stop again. Then, Jacolliot demanded that the metal tones should sound again at the end of ten seconds, and the phenomenon was repeated at the exact moment, which he noted by his own watch. He asked that the sounds should keep time to the tune of a music box, which he wound up for the purpose. This requirement, too, was fulfilled. Buried For Three Months. Other demonstrations of the Yoga, even more startling and seemingly more impossible, have been recorded. Sir Claude Wade, in company with several English army officers, witnessed a demonstration at Lahore, India, that even more fully demonstrated the power of the fakir to suspend life in his own body. This fakir was buried quite naturally in a grave dug for the purpose, and the earth was piled in upon him. Sir Claude took every precaution against the body being disturbed, keeping a guard about the grave constantly. At the expiration of three months, the time specified for the end of the demonstration, he superintended the disinterment of the man, who, when the earth had been removed, walked from the grave alive and well. During the interim, he had been hermetically sealed, and had had nothing to eat or drink, thus proving beyond the question of a doubt, his ability to suspend breathing and animation at will. Other Demonstrations. Other familiar demonstrations of the Yogi are the throwing of a rope into the air, the demonstrator climbing up to an invisible height, finally vanishing completely; the appearance and disappearance of the operator at will before his audience; the ability to withstand the application of hot irons and sword thrusts with seeming indifference, and the control that enables him to pose for hours at a time in an apparently cramped condition without the movement of a muscle.",No timeline found

The secret revealed by Karma Yoga teaches how to avoid this waste and also the nervous disorders which are the outcome. ""Then comes Bhakti Yoga. I find not only your women but also the men, the business and professional men, much in need of this teaching. It is for those of an emotional nature. It is the path of devotion and love. It teaches how to fulfill the purpose of life both here and in the hereafter. ""The third is Raja Yoga, the path of concentration and meditation. This field covers the whole psychic plane and describes the processes by which the psychic powers are developed, such as thought reading, clairvoyance, clairaudience, the evolving of finer perceptions, the going out of the body, the curing of disease through mental power. Everything taught in such kindred treatments as mental healing, Christian Science, the Emmanuel movement has been taught as one element of a great whole for generation after generation by the believers and followers of the Vedanta. ""Displayed by Jesus of Nazareth and which are used today by the so-called new sects have been an open book for years to the Yogis or wise men of India. Christian Science, the new Emmanuel, can give us nothing new. But we do not overemphasize peculiar cult; we do not believe in the constant obsession of the mind by the thought of disease, even though the healing of the disease is the ultimate reason for that obsession. ""It is in Raja Yoga that the wonderful system of breathing is taught, whose effects are not unknown to the mental healers of the West, but it does not cease to warn its students that the attainment of any of these powers is not a sign of spirituality. ""Jnana Yoga is the fourth method. It is the path of right knowledge and discrimination. It is for those who are of a philosophic nature. It explains the fundamental principles of spiritualism, tells us how the soul exists after death and under what conditions, describes how the earthbound are reincarnated, taking human form again and again.

One of these is the fact that many young girls, girls as young as 10 or 12 years of age, find it necessary to rest from school work or mental and physical exertion of any kind, temporarily, and take a rest cure, just as the jaded society woman withdraws from her social activities to recuperate, and during the retirement they are taught the value of absolute relaxation. The other is that, simultaneously with the scientific study of rest and relaxation by the young girl of today, the Yogi treatment and philosophy are brought into prominence by the leaders in the Emmanuel movement who rely upon this old Hindu method for restoring the mind and body to a natural and healthful condition. Yogi breathing, Yogi physical exercises and Yogi philosophy of relaxation are made a feature of the practical side of the Emmanuel treatment of certain cases, and this form of treatment is proved to be so beneficial in restoring wasted mental and physical force that the method is now being applied to young persons, the idea being that the sooner a girl learns how to rest and relax scientifically the stronger will be her vitality and the better will be her ability to withstand the strain that modern life puts upon the individual. It is not because girls are breaking down earlier or are showing a loss of nervous force at a younger age than formerly that they are being taught how to take care of themselves after the oriental fashion, but because parents and guardians see that it is important to them to learn as early as possible the value of this quaint and simple philosophy which has been practiced centuries upon centuries and has brought about excellent results. The difficulty experienced by a grown person in learning to relax properly and to rest perfectly is multiplied by that person's years. It follows quite naturally, then, that the earlier one begins studying this science the easier it comes to one and the greater are its advantages all during life. Besides the beneficial effects derived from the practice of Hindu philosophy and physical exercises the idea of the science can not fail to appeal to the young girl. The principle of the treatment is simple to understand and the rules are easy to follow, while the results are almost always immediate enough to be encouraging and to stimulate interest in the cult. One of the hardest things to do is to relax completely. Some persons think they are letting go of their muscles, but in reality they are not. Instead, the grip of their muscles is tense and it is almost impossible for them to relax even after a series of mental and physical treatment. Relaxing is partly mental, so that youthful minds are easier to grasp this idea than grown persons. AMONG the best relaxing exercises are those which start with the body standing and letting go of each muscle and joint separately. First the arms are outstretched in front and the fingers are permitted to drop, to fall of themselves, and when they are perfectly limp and inactive then the relaxing should be continued to the forearm, then to the upper arm, letting the whole arm drop loosely at the side and not only remain motionless but possess the sensation of utter relaxation. These exercises in letting go of the tension of the muscles should be continued to the feet, then the legs, the pupil lifting and dropping each one in turn; then to the shoulders and the head by letting the latter fall loosely as it will either in front or to one side and the whole pupil relax the body ""slumping"" forward. Even the waist and the hips can be relaxed, although the loosening of the tension will be less noticeable. Now, after the various muscles have been taught what perfect relaxation means and this is only the beginning of the treatment—lie down on a couch or a bed that is not too soft and let go of the entire body, supplementing the physical relaxation with a mental attention to these muscles and members of the body. The Hindu maintains that the mind must be fixed on the muscle relaxation in order to get the best results and to make the ""letting go"" thorough and complete, especially when one is learning the first principles of relaxing. Resting like this once or twice during the day will restore one quickly to normal condition, and a few minutes devoted to perfect relaxation are worth an hour or more of sleep of the ordinary kind. It sounds more or less absurd to one who does not understand the art and science of relaxation and perfect rest to say that one's energy and vitality can be restored without having the pupil lie down. The method to pursue in this quick restoration process is to think of oneself in their active position; that is, with the head up, shoulders back and chest expanded slightly. The arms should be allowed to drop loosely at the sides. While in this position the body on the balls of the feet, lifting the heels gradually and throwing them back to the floor. the weight forward, with the body still held erect and not tilted forward. As the heels rise the arms should be lifted straight out at the sides and upward until they pass above the horizontal line. Breathe deeply as the arms ascend, then hold the position for a minute or so and gradually let the heels drop down and the arms fall limply at the sides, not forgetting to exhale slowly and evenly as the original position is resumed. PROPER breathing has quite as much to do with the success of the relaxing and the muscle exercises as the movements themselves. One can fall into what approaches a mesmerized state just by breathing in the oriental fashion and continuing the action for a few minutes. While lying flat on your back raise the right hand to the nostrils, and with the finger or the thumb close one side tightly, making it necessary to breathe through the other. Rhythmical breathing is essential to perfect repose. With the hand at the nostrils alternate by inhaling through the right side and exhaling through the left, then reversing the order by closing the other side. Instead of expanding the chest first as you breathe try abdominal breathing for the rest cure by continuing the reclining position and alternating the nostrils as inhalers and exhalers. Then begin by taking a deep breath from deep down in the abdominal region, gradually inflating the other parts of the chest and lungs as the breathing is continued on up to the very tops of the lungs. In this way the abdomen, chest, and even the upper section of the lungs or the collarbone are raised and expanded with the air. Hold it a few seconds, then exhale by first drawing in the abdomen, then dropping the lower part of the chest and finally allowing the upper part to fall as much as possible breathing is essential to perfect repose. With the hand at the nostrils alternate by inhaling through the right side and exhaling through the left, then reversing the order by closing the other side. Instead of expanding the chest first as you breathe, try abdominal breathing for the rest cure by continuing the reclining position and alternating the nostrils as inhalers and exhalers. Then begin by taking a deep breath from deep down in the abdominal region, gradually inflating the other parts of the chest and lungs as the breathing is continued on up to the very tops of the lungs. In this way the abdomen, chest, and even the upper section of the lungs or the collarbone are raised and expanded with the air. Hold it a few seconds, then exhale by first drawing in the standing position, with the feet spread a little apart, heels almost touching, head up, shoulders back, chest expanded and the abdomen drawn in. This is the way to start. Then, if you want to begin with an easy exercise, stretch the arms forward in front, keeping them level with the shoulders, and with the palms of the hands pressed together gently, not rigidly, swing the arms back, keeping them on the same horizontal plane until they are as far back of the shoulders as they will go. At first you will not be able to touch the backs of the hands, but after a little practice this will come quite readily. Do this quickly backward and forward for 10 times and then see how much better the muscles of the back feel and how much easier it is to stand erect.",No timeline found

They then went to heaven, traveled through hell, explored space and returned to earth to tell their people all about those regions. Their secret was ""Yoga""—the Indian way of controlling mind and body.Rishis (saints) Brataharti, Markandeya, the Saptarishi brothers and Narad are some notable legendary figures who lived a world life for as much as 2000 years and then left for a heavenly abode at their will. ""Yoga"" is a comprehensive term which embodies a number of postures called ""asans."" These ""asans"" are dependent upon the physiology of the body and its muscular and nervous systems. The ""Yoga"" system has three divisions, Karma Yoga, Hatha Yoga and Gyan Yoga. Karma Yoga is practiced to achieve peace of mind while living in this world. Its best exposition is found in the Gita, the Hindus' holy bible. Hatha Yoga has preventive as well as curative qualities for all ailments, Hindus believe. Perfection in this Yoga system would make a man capable of living in any climatic conditions without any difficulty. Deep breathing and meditation are the essence of Yoga. Prime Minister Nehru and his daughter Indira practice part of Hatha Yoga. Nehru now no longer stands on his head. But he does deep breathing almost every day. Hatha Yoga is regarded as a prime Yoga effort which gradually comes to be the methodical approach to the attainment of the highest in the Yoga. Hatha Yoga accepts man for what he really is. It therefore does not neglect the physical aspect of a person's life. Yoga experts recommend Hatha Yoga for space flights among other things. Gyan Yoga is the highest form of Yoga. By achieving perfection in this branch, according to Hindus, a person can leave his body at will, travel as far as he likes and then re-enter his body.",No timeline found

Yoga es una palabra sánscrita que significa literalmente unión, aunque también tiene las acepciones de “contemplación” y “concentración”. Por yoga se comprende el método que ha de seguir el hombre para llegar a la mística unión con Dios. Los indúistas reconocen varias clases de yoga: los yoga de sabiduría, donde se logra la liberación por medio de la comprensión, conocimientos y sabiduría adquiridos por el ejercicio de la razón pura. La Yoga-Raja, o yoga mental que consiste en el dominio de la mente y del cuerpo mediante la actuación de la voluntad, de acuerdo con ciertos métodos, como el de la respiración rítmica. La Yoga-Karma, o yoga de acción que consiste en la realización de buenas obras. La Yoga-Bhakti o devocional que consiste en el sincero anhelo de la unión amorosa con el infinito, es una yoga mística donde se pide a Dios amor y devoción pero se abstienen de pedir favores y merecedes personales como hacemos nosotros con nuestros santos. Hay además el Hatha-yoga, que es muy susceptible de perversión pues suele conducir a la magia negra a los espíritus pusilánimes.",No timeline found

Estaban en el cielo, recorrían los infiernos, rondaban por el espacio y regresaban a la tierra para contarle todo a la gente. Su secreto era el Yoga, la manera india de controlar la mente y el cuerpo. Los Rishis (santos) Bratahari, Markandeya Saptarishi y Narad son algunas de las figuras legendarias que vivieron una vida terrestre durante 2,000 años y luego la dejaron, por la celestia, por su propia voluntad. ""Yoga"" es un término amplio que comprende una cantidad de posturas llamadas “Asans.” Estas “Asans” dependen de la fisiología del cuerpo y su sistema muscular y nervioso. El sistema ""Yoga"" tiene tres divisiones, el Karma Yoga, el Hatha Yoga y el Gyan Yoga. El Karma Yoga se practica para lograr la paz de la mente en este mundo. Su mejor exposición se encuentra en el Gita, la biblia de los hindúes. El Hatha Yoga tiene cualidades curativas, así como preventivas, para todos los males. La perfección en este sistema yoga, haría a un hombre capaz de vivir en cualquier condición climática sin dificultad alguna. La respiración profunda y la meditación constituyen la esencia del yoga. El Primer Ministro de India, Jawaharlal Nehru, y su hija, Indira, practican parte del Hatha Yoga. Nehru no se pone cabeza abajo, pero hace aspiraciones profundas todos los días. Se considera el Hatha Yoga como un esfuerzo primario que, gradualmente, llega a reconocerse en el acercamiento a la perfección de la mente",No timeline found

Street, wealthy radio executive, to take his meals regularly. Then, as if that were not enough, Mrs. Edith Street lived in despair because she could not account for a series of strange happenings. At least, according to Mrs. Street, when Robert Street got a notion to judge her mental equilibrium, he did it in a way that seemed to defy all reason. “Yoga,” he explained, is that mystic philosophy of the East, whose exponents rise to triumph in all kinds of weird feats, such as attitude making themselves invisible. Yogis, as the practitioners of Yoga are called, eat carrots, stand on their heads and squat. Learning that Robert had acquired his taste for these activities at the exquisite feet of Miss Barnes, his wife went into a New York court and charged as much. She said he’d told her that Yogi High Priestess Carman had given him “new life, new love, new hope and a complete new cycle”—by which he did not mean a bicycle. He meant a life cycle, which is something you have over and over again, like the common cold. Her testimony won Mrs. Street a new separation and new alimony. Robert, meanwhile, had skipped out to Reno and won himself a full-dress divorce. At least, it was full-dress everywhere but in New York. There, the courts considered his wife’s suit the more formal, so his was fruitless. Mr. Street was dissatisfied, as a consequence, and it seems a fair surmise that Mrs. Street was a little dissatisfied, too. Whether or not she then proceeded to work off her Yoga-bred dissatisfaction by getting another woman's husband to do things he hadn’t done before is a question which Mrs. Edith Marko now has asked the New York courts to pass upon. If the answer is “Yes,” as Mrs. Marko believes, then she will win a separation from her Robert, plus $500 a week alimony and $5,000 for her lawyers. Mrs. Marko's description of Mrs. Street is scarcely that of a wife unable to hold a husband. She calls her, ""A Jezebel, a Lorelei, full of guile, who sings songs of love, making foolish men mad with desire."" Curiously enough, the incident which allegedly showed Mrs. Street in her new colors was precipitated not by Mrs. Marko but by Mr. Street, who all this time has been biding his time, dissatisfied. The detectives, who raided her Bucks County, Pa., retreat a while ago, were his detectives. And, as they walked into the house, they testified, down the stairs came the lady of the house and Mrs. Marko’s Robert, convivially wearing bathrobes. Mrs. Street and Mr. Marko, for their part, assert that they weren’t there to play, but to write a play. After kindly turning over his alleged findings to Mrs. Marko, so she could start suing, Mr. Street started suing again himself, in the New York courts this time. He asked for a divorce, and if not that an annulment, and if not THAT at least a separation.",No timeline found
