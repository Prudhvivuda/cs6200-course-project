          Chicago, Juno 21. If there was
          doubt about the nomination of Fair
          banks, of Indiana, for vlco-presldent,
          We developments have set It at rest
          When Pennsylvania and New York
          fell Into line, the other boomlets did
          tot have a leg to stand on. Cannons
          forceful and picturesque expressions
          on the subject of his own candidacy.
          I settled the matter, so far as the New
          York scheme to nominate him was
          concerned. Roosevelt kept his hands
          out of the fight, but Cornelius Bliss,
          ho represented the President, was
          consulted, and acquiesced in the pro
          gram. There will be no fight in tho
          con?entlon, although there may be
          complimentary votes for a number of
          others, whose enthusiastic friends
          refuse to permit tho withdrawal of
          their names. Rebellious talk against
          the selection of.Cortolyou for the na
          tional chairmanship has almost en
          tirely iubsided, nor Is there longer
          tilt c a compromise, looking either
          to Oortolyous .selection, his .subse
          quent resignation, to accept the post
          master-generalship or looking to the
          selection of Cortelyou as chairman, of
          tie executive committee and choico
          of some one else to preside on the na
          tional committee Itself. Cortelyou is
          detained in New York on account of
          the Slocurm disaster, but is expected
          tere Wednesday. His coming, how
          erer, U11 have little effect on the sit-
          tatlon. The, hopes of tho tariff re
          idjusters for a revision plank in tho
          platform are doomed to disappoint
          ment, but little talk being heard fore
          shadowing the slightest concessions
          on the part of the stand-patters.
          But Western delegates continue tho
          sjitation against an anti-polygamy
          Pbnk, a matter In which delegates
          from Utah, Idaho, Colorado, Wyoming
          ud other intermountain common
          wealths are standing together. Anoth
          er fruitful topic for Westerners is the
          .statehood question, the last two con
          gresses having refused to carry out
          tho platform pledges looking to tho
          admission of Oklahoma, Arizona and
          New Mexico. The statehood boomers
          have not lost hope, and tho struggle
          will bo renewed before tho commit
          tee on resolutions.
          Roosevelt In the Saddle.
          Chicago, June 21. It is a Roosevelt
          convention now. Tho change has
          come with the arrival of tho great
          mass of the delegates, and thousands
          of hustling Republicans. Roosevelt
          badges galore adorn the coats of men
          to be seen on tho streets, men not reg
          Istered among the leaders and in the
          parlor conferences. Until Monday the
          anti-leaders held sway. They were
          tho old guard of the machine organi
          zation, whose own great purpose was
          to perpetuate their rule, some of
          whom were antl Roosevelt, and In
          whoso eyes tho President Is a politic
          al accident, and who bad1 to be given
          a renomination by force of circum
          stances. They threw cold1 water
          wherever Roosevelt sentiment ap
          peared, ignoring tho President in the
          convention arrangements, and had not
          thought of him in planning the decor
          ations. Most important of all, they
          decided, that one of their own selec
          tion should bo the new chairman of
          the committee, andi national leader of
          the party. Then it was that the Pres
          idents friends on the ground made a
          determined stand, Insisting that Cor
          telyou should have tho place. These
          Roosevelt men held their guns until
          tho army of delegates began flocking
          In Sunday night.

          Chicago, June 23. The last and
          greatest day of the Republican na
          tional convention was the apothesls of
          the big show, the climax to which tho
          events of the past two days have been
          the Introduction. Today Theodore
          Roosevelt was nominated to succeed
          himself as President, and Charles W.
          Fairbanks, senator from Indiana, was
          named as vice-president. With tho
          candllates of the party selected tho
          convention adjourned, tho delegations
          dispersing1 to spread into every re
          mote section of the country a conta
          gion of enthusiastic fever which has
          been enthused into them at this great
          gathering by the leaders of the grand
          old party of protection.
          This was a day of oratorical pyro
          technics. Somo of the finest speakers
          In the Republican organization were
          heard in common chorus in praise of
          the men who aro to lead the hosts to
          battle. Elated by tho ovents and the
          speeches of the last two days, and
          eagerly anticipating -the intellectual
          treat in store today, tho delegates be
          gan to assemble in tho convention hall
          early this morning. Becauso of im
          portant workin hand the convention
          was called to assemble at 10 oclock.
          Half hour before the floor presented
          an animated scene. Many delegates
          brought flags with them to assist in
          the demonstration which they were
          prepared to make when Roosevelt was
          placed in nomination. An increased
          interest in the convention was also
          shown In the galleries, which began to
          fill ns soon as tho doors opened at 9
          oclock. By tho time Chairman Can
          non called tho assembly to order near
          ly every seat was occupied, and short
          ly after standing room was at a pre
          mium. There was a larger proportion
          of ladies present than at either of the
          previous sessions, and their summer
          costumes lent a touch of color to the
          otherwise sombro rows of black coats.
          The first outburst of applause was
          ovoked by Margaret Elizabeth Plum
          mer, national organizer of the Ameri
          can Flag Asosciation, who was
          dressed in a stunning gown of cream
          colored silk, who surprised Chairman
          Cannori by presenting him with a
          great bunch of calla lilies, after mak
          ing a graceful little speech. Secretary
          Cortelyjpu was on the platform. As
          soon riS he mado his appearance many
          prominent leaders pressed forward to
          shake hands and assure him of their
          loyalty and assistance in the great
          work he is about to undertake as
          chairman of the national committee.
          Every membor of tho New York
          delegation, under instructions from
          Senators Plat tand Depow, was sup
          plied with fine silk flags, and their
          eritranco was greeted with loud ap
          plause Everybody arose while the
          band played America.
          Tho convention hall filled rapidly at
          an early hour, and every seat was
          filled when Chairman called it to or
          der at 10 oclock.
          Rev. Thaddius E. Snlvely opened
          the convention with prayer.
          Alabama yielded to New York on
          the call of states. Chairman Cannon
          then introduced ex-Governor Black
          amid great applause.
          At 10:41 a. m. tho clerk called tho
          roll of states for the presentation of
          the names of candidates.
          When ex-Governor Black finished
          speaking there was great applause,
          and the delegates were on their feet.
          Chairman Cannon stood on tho plat
          form with a tattered battloflag. The
          bands were playing, delegates were
          on their feet, and a massive picture of
          Theodore Roosevelt shown on tho
          platform brought forth renewed ap
          plause. The delegates of New York made a
          circuit of the hall, while the band
          played tho Star Spangled Banner.
          Chairman Cannon lead in singing
          the Star Spangled Banner, and the.
          band played A Hot Time in tho Old
          Town Tonight.
          Senator Boveridge, of Indiana, sec
          onded Roosevelts nomination with a
          stirring speech, and the enthusiasm
          is on tho Increase.
          Chairman Cannon was compellod to
          use tho gavel a number of times to
          bring the convention to order.
          The entire audience is slpging Tho
          Star Spangled Banner, and there are
          no signs of order. Delegations with
          red, white and blue umbrellas are
          making a circuit of the hall.
          Tho convention was still shouting
          for Roosevelt when Chairman Cannon
          again appeared on the platform with
          tho tattered flag, which brought forth
          renewed cheers, and tho convention
          was in an uproar, and pandemonium
          reigned for somo time.
          Geo. A. Knight, of California, sec
          onded Roosevelts nomination on be
          half of the coast states.
          Harry Stilwell Edwards, of Georgia,
          seconded the nomination with a bril
          liant speech.
          Ex-Governor Bradley, of Kentucky,
          made a seconding speech.
          Hary S. Cummlngs, tho colored ora
          tor of Maryland, and Jos. B. Cotton,
          of Minnesota, followed with short
          speeches seconding the nomination.
          When New Jersey was reached
          they asked for unanimous consent for
          tho convention to dispense with furth
          er roll call and nominate Roosevelt by
          acclamation, but the Idea did not moot
          with favor.
          When tho roll call was ended no
          namo had been mentioned but that of
          Roosovelt, and ho received tho total
          994 votes of tho convention.
          In his characteristic stylo Senator
          Dolllver, of Iowa, placed Fairbanks in
          nomination. He paid a glowing
          tribute to tho policies of tho Republi
          can party, and to the leaders respon
          sible for tho exposition of these poli
          cies. Gradually hut adroitly he led
          up to his eulogy of tho Indiana
          statesman. Dollivers peroration was
          In the following werdB:
          While ho has not sought to con
          strain tho Judgment of tho conven
          tion, directly or indirectly, he lias
          kept himself free from affectation
          which undervalues tho dignity of the
          second ofilco within the gift of tho
          American people, and I do not doubt
          that his heart has been touched by
          tho volunteer expression of universal
          good will, which already has choson
          him a one of tho standard bearers
          for tho Republican party of tho United
          States. Tho ofilco has sought tho
          man, and ho will bring to the office
          the conmnding personality jot a states
          man equal to any of Jthe groat1 respon
          sibilities which belong to our public
          affairs.
          A leader of the senate and a cham
          plon of all great policies which constl
          tute tho invincible record of the Re
          publican party during tho last 10
          years, his namo will become a towor
          of strength to our cause, not only in

          ical associates have reposed in him
          from the beginning of his public life.

          Republicans stand, with no dissent
          ing voice hero or anywhere, has long
          since anticipated1 tho action of this

          Sitting tilted back in a big armchair
          at his desk the President chatted freely
          and frankly with those about him. AH
          were his personal friends, and the Pres
          ident realized perfectly that the little
          confidences of the executive session,
          as he himself termed It. would be held
          as Inviolable. He talked and acted not
          as President of the United States, not
          President Roosevelt rose from his
          chair to receive the affectionate con
          gratulations of those about him. He
          was the most unconcerned, seemingly,
          of all. He chatted animatedly a few
          minutes with Mrs. Roosevelt, Miss
          Carew and Loeb, and then accom
          panied his secretary to the executive
          offices.
          ATTENDS. TO ROUTINE WORK.
          Outward indications that Theodore
          Roosevelt was to be chosen unanimous
          ly as the standard-bearer of his party
          absolutely were lacking at the White
          House in the morning. The President
          appeared at his desk at the usual hour
          and began immediately to transact rou
          tine executive business with Secretary
          Loeb. The important subjects disposed
          of, he received several visitors .for
          «hom engagements had been made.
          No members of the Cabinet called dur
          ing the early hours of the business
          day. The President was kept In close
          touch with the situation at Chicago
          through the press bulletins and private
          messages from the convention hall,
          which were received over a special
          wire at the White House.

          WASHINGTON, June 23.—Surround
          ed by members of his family. President
          Roosevelt received the announcement
          that he had been nominated unani
          mously by the Republicans at Chicago.
          The news was received by telephone at
          the White House by a press repre
          sentative In advance of its receipt over
          the special telegraph wire running from
          Chicago to the executive offices.
          At 1i:lZ p. m. the bulletin was given
          to Secretary Loeb. Some time previ
          ously the President had left his offices
          in the executive building and had gone
          to the White House for luncheon. Sec
          retary Loeb immediately conveyed the
          news to him there. Seated on the
          veranda of the White House, chatting
          with Mrs. Roosevelt, his sister-in-law.

          INVITATION* FROM FRANCIS.
          After Cortelyous remarks Elmer Do
          ver. of Ohio was named as secretary by
          Senator. Scott. Cornelius N. Bliss of
          New York for treasurer by Governor

          unanimously re-elected.
          ¦No vice chairman will be appointed,
          and the new chairman will divide his
          time between the New York and Chi
          cago headquarters, although some
          members of. the committee no doubt
          will be designated to take charge of
          the headquarters In this city. Head
          quarters will not be opened in either
          city until l the latter part of July.
          Meanwhile Cortelyou expects to select
          the executive committee and make his
          preliminary arrangements for the cam
          paign.
          s As soon as the committee was called
          to order, Postmaster General Payne, in
          a complimentary speech, nominated
          Cortelyou- for chairman, and the elec
          tion was made without a dissenting
          voice. Clayton of Arkansas, Murphy of
          New Jersey and Yerkes of Kentucky
          were appointed a committee to notify
          the new chairman and bring him be
          fore the committee.
          CHICAGO, June 23.— George B. Cor
          telyou was chosen chairman of the
          Republican •National Committee at a
          meeting held to-day, just after the ad
          journment of the national convention.
          2n thanking the committee for the
          honor, he told the members that, whHe
          he would be glad to have the benefit
          of their, advice and counsel, he in
          tended to be chairman in fact, and
          would accept no dictation from any one,
          high or low. He told them that the
          friends of the late Chairman Hanna
          were his friends, and he asked for
          the same measure of confidence and
          support that had been given to the
          late chairman. In conclusion, he
          sought the advice of both old and new

          exhibit approval of the nomination
          accepted every signal for renewed
          -cheering. A little colored boy from
          Georgia, and later a pretty little girl
          dressed in a dainty frock of white, were
          lifted to the platform, where they
          waved flags vigorously.
          At the conclusion of every seconding
          speech the outburst was repeated, and
          the speakers themselves were generally
          applauded.
          The chairman tired and his place was
          taken by a young man, who grasped
          the flagstaff firmly in one hand and
          with a megaphone led the yelling. He
          started to yell, Roosevelt, Roosevelt,
          Roosevelt, repeated over a^d over
          over again, with the system of a college
          yell. It was taken up by the throng,
          and the cry of Jioosevelt rolled over
          the hall in volumes so great and so ter
          rific that the screeching of a hundred
          steam whistrw v/ouid have been
          dwarfed in comparison.
          LIKE A COLLEGE YELL.
          When Governor Black of New York
          made his speech nominating President
          Roosevelt to succeed himself as Presi
          dent, the delegates in the Republican
          Convention proved there was no ab-
          Fcnce of enthusiasm in their ranks
          when occasion Justified an exhibition
          cf that Quality. For twenty-five min
          utes the great throng told its approba
          tion of the conventions choice for
          President. The name of Roosevelt
          came from every mouth. The New
          York delegates paraded the hall, shout
          ing at the top of their voices. Other
          delegations joined the procession, and
          the- weJ! ordered body of a half hour
          before was a shifting mass, every
          eemblance of organization gone.
          While the demonstration was at its
          height Chairman Cannon stepped to
          the front of tne stage. He held in his
          hand the banner which was waved in
          1SG0 when Lincoln was nominated, and
          •which fcas been used in every conven
          tion since. The flex showed the wear
          and tear of many similar contests.
          Uncle Joe wa\-cd It vigorously and
          kept time with his body. Soon the
          ¦whole convention was swaying in exact
          measure.
          1 rfiii^i by a resounding demonstration
          vbich attested the candidates great
          popularity. The charing was l=d by
          figures known through the breadth of
          the land and echoed by a mighty
          throne of enthusiastic men and radiant
          vomen assembled in the Coliseum to
          witness the crowning feature of the
          convention, as well as the close of th*
          rational meeting that marks the semi
          centennial of the Republican party in
          the United States.
          No less than 10,000 men and women
          participated in the ratification of the
          party programme and the consequent
          roar of cheering and handclapping was
          de&feninp. The band, stationed high
          among tho girders of the hall, was
          browned by the tumultuous, unbounded
          demonstration. Hats were tossed into
          the air, State emblems were waved
          and flags beautiful, tri-colored, shim
          mering, silktn flags fluttered from
          every hand, as though stirred by a
          RIOT OF ENTHUSIASM.

          Lake Michigan.
          Geography counts but little with the
          sentiment and enthusiasm that is to
          day apparent in favor of one who is to
          be given all the honors anoTduties of
          an elected President of the United
          States, Knight said when silence was
          restored. Continuing in epigramatic
          style he thrilled the convention for
          many minutes. His voice never fal
          tered. His name was spoken in terms
          of congratulation on every side. When
          he had ceased, and with waving ban
          ners the California delegation marched
          to the platform to escort him to his
          seat, the great Coliseum rocked with
          the cheers of the multitude.
          Californias headquarters were in
          darkness to-night. The wines and fruits
          had been distributed among the fortu
          nate friends cf the delegates and the
          last toast had been drunk. Several of;
          the delegates have departed already,
          and more will go to-morrow. Within
          three days the last California delegata
          will have departed from Chicago.
          PARDEE GOES TO -T. LOUIS.
          Again the tempest broke. Out of the
          wilderness of silence had come a
          human voice. It had been heard and
          understood. The convention was over
          joyed: its enthusiasm must find vent.
          THRILLS THE CONTENTION.
          Knights voice reached to the farthest
          pillar and echoed back from the giant
          arches. With a howl of delight the con
          vention arose, and the waving flags
          with their crimson stripes were like a
          sea of flame. Speaker Cannon, with
          the gavel in his left hand pounding for
          order and his right uplifted command
          ing silence. wa3 ignored. For minutes
          the uproar continued. When silence
          came again Knight continued:
          ••Geography counts

          DELEGATION*. CHICAGO. June 23
          Californias triumph came to-day In the
          national convention. Her triumph was
          that of George A. Knight, th« eloquent
          lawyer of San Francisco. From 10:3*
          oclock until long after noon the per
          spirins delegates had been listening to
          the*disiineuished men of the East. Ex-
          Governor Black of New York had
          placed Mr. Roosevelt In nomination,
          and Senator Boveridge of Indiana had
          delivered the iirst seconding speech. To
          those in the rear galleries and side
          seats their efforts were nausht but
          mere pantomime. No sound strayed
          from a direct line in front of the plat
          form until Knight opened his masterly
          address.

          This ticket was presented 1W live suffrages of the American people

          When ex-Governor Black had named the President to succeed him
          self the enthusiasm was unbounded and the tumult of applause could not
          be stayed for twenty-three minutes by the clock.
          The same exhibitions of delight marked the presentation of the name
          of Senator Fairbanks for the second office in the #itt of the nation.
          Secretary Cortelyou was unanimously chosen a.s chairman of the
          National Committee, resigning as the head of the Department of Com
          merce and Lahor immediately after his election.
          The President received the news at the White House, and con
          gratulatory messages were interchanged between him and Senator Fair
          banks.
          The Committee on Notification, headed by Speaker Cannon, will
          officially inform the President at Oyster Bay on July 27. Another com

          of the Danish steam er Norge, which
          foundered off Rochall reef June 28,
          h-was landed at Aberdeen, Scotland, last
          flight by the steam trawler Largo Bay.
          The contingent now being cared for
          rat Aberdeen consists of twelve pas
          sengers, the third mate of the Norge,
          the quartermaster, a steward, a lamp
          .trimmer and one of the crew. They
          drifted at the mercy of the Atlantic
          .for six days. When both water and
          food were gone, and when the occu
          pants were almost too exhaust ed even
          to hope, the trawler hove in sight on

          When the survivors we re dragged on
          boa rd the trawler the fishermen we re
          i obliged foroibly to prevent them from
          eating and drinking too much.
          The third mate says that three other
          boats started with that rescued by the
          Largo Bay. One of those contained
          thirty-two persons, including several
          women and children. Another boat
          had fifteen men, with the second mate
          \in charge. The third boat had ten
          men on board. The survivors parted
          company with the three boats on
          July 3.

          tieth anniversary of the birth of the
          republican party under the oaks in
          this city July 6, 1854. It was here
          then that the first state convention,
          acting under the name of republi-
          can, was held. The state ticket
          nominated on that day went thru a
          heated campaign to election day suc
          cess.
          Secretary of State John Hay, who
          was private secretary to Abraham

          An interesting feature of the exer

          for whom 1,000 prominent seats had

          Address of Secretary Hay.
          Soon after p.m. the program at the
          grove was resumed. Senator J. O.
          Burrows of Michigan introduoed Sec
          retary John Hay, the orator of the af
          ternoon.
          Secretary Hay reviewed the record
          of the republican party since its be
          ginning with the ability of a states
          ma n, a historian and an orator com
          bineW* Perhaps he, as no other man
          In the country, knows the history of
          the party. When it Is said,-therefore,
          that his review of the partys past was
          masterly, the word masterly
          all that it an mean as -so applied.
          Mr. Hay, passing from the history of
          the party to the present and imme
          diate future, said, in part:
          W are not claiming that we monopo
          lize the virue of the patriotism of the
          country There are good men all par
          ties, I know far better men than I am
          who are democrats. But we are surely
          allowed, in a lo\e feast like this, to talk
          of what has been done by the family and
          at least to brag a little of the democrats
          who have helped us. We come before the
          country in a position which cannot be
          successfully attacked in front, or flank,
          or rear. What we have done, what -we
          are doing, and what we intend to doon
          all three we confidently challenge the
          verdict of the American people The
          record of fifty years will show whether as
          a party we are fit to govern the state of
          our domestic and foreign affairs will
          show whether as a party we have fallen
          off, and both together will show whether
          we can be trusted for a while longer.
          7 means
          The 1004 Platform.
          Our platform Is before the country.
          There is certainly nothing sensational
          about it It is substantially the platform
          on which we won two great victories in
          the name of McKinley, and it is still
          sound and serviceable. Its principles have
          been tested by eight years of splendid
          success and have received the approval
          of the country. We stand by the ancient
          nays which have proved good.
          It would take a wizard to guess what a
          dainty dish our adversaries will set before
          the sovereign people tomorrow. One thing
          is reasonably sure: They will get as near
          to our platform as they possibly can and
          they will by implication approve everything
          McKinley and Roosevelt have done In the
          last four years. They will favor sound
          finance and a tariff which will not disturb
          business rigid honesty in administration
          and prompt punishment of the dishonest
          the Monroe doctrine and an isthmian
          canal. To be logical they ought to go on
          and nominate the republican candidates
          who are pledged to all these laudable poli
          cies.
          Roosevelt as an Issue,
          But they will not be logical. They an
          nounce* their plan of campaign to be not
          pro-anything, but anti-Roosevelt.
          Even on this issue they will dodge most
          of the details. Ask them, has the presi
          dent been a good citizen, a good soldier, a
          good man in all personal relations? Is
          he a man of Intelligence, of education?
          Does he Know this country well? Does he
          know the world outside? Has he studied
          law, history, and politics? Has he had
          great chances to learn, and has he im
          proved them? Is he sound and strong in
          mind, body and soul? Is he accessible and
          friendly to all sorts and conditions of
          men? Has he the courage and the candor,
          and the God-given ability to speak to the
          people and tell them what he thinks?
          To all these questions they will answer
          yes Then what is your objection to
          him? They will either stand speechless or
          they will answer with the parrot cry
          which we have heard so often: He is un
          safe!
          In a certain sense we shall have to ad
          mit this to be true. To every grade of
          lawbreaker, high or low to a man who
          would rob a till or a ballot box t$ the
          sneak or the bully to the hypocrite and
          the humbug, Theodore Roosevelt is more
          than unsafe he is positively dangerous.
          Coefficients of Safety.
          But- let us be serious with these good
          people. What are the coefficients of safety
          in a chief of state? He should have cour
          age the wisest coward that ever lived Is
          not fit to rule. And intelligence we want
          no blunder-headed hero in the White
          House. And honesty a clever thief would
          do infinite mischief. These three are the

          Mr. Lind himself is disposed to be
          philosophical, and laughs at the three
          hour squabble, but he to ok a most
          active part in it while it lasted. A
          for is friends, they are bitter in de
          nounci ng the Hearst men for turning
          down their old leader. The mildest
          term applied to the Hearst delegates
          is that they are crazy.
          The discussion la st night ranged
          over every Incident of the recent state
          campaign, which was fought over
          aga in in every gory detail. Frank

          able, Tho Opponents May
          Defeat Him.
          From a Btaff Correspondent.
          St. Louis, July 6.The opening day
          oil the democratic national convention
          sees the situation as to the presiden
          tial nomination unchanged. Parker
          Is far in the lead and is nomination
          seems likely. A the same time,
          however, his prospects are no more
          favorable at this time than tho se of
          many a defeated candidate for the
          nomination have been before him and
          it may yet be possible for his enemieB
          to concentrate against him and defeat
          hi m. The fact that thjy are as actively
          at ~woric tod ay as at any previous
          time, and profess to be hopeful of,
          success, makes confident prediction
          that Parker will certainly be nomin
          ated somewhat unsafe.
          The trend of even ts is so distinctly
          toward Parker, however, as to indi
          cate his early nomination, possibly by
          the second ballot. If it were a betting
          proposition, I shou ld say the chances
          were at least seven out of ten in Park
          ers favor.
          Tammany is now acting as it did in
          1892, when it counseled against their
          renominati on of Cleveland, saying he
          could not carry New York. A form al
          statement of the Tammany position
          was giv en out in Chicago when the
          convention was in progress. The con
          vention disregarded the opposition ot
          Tammany and renominated Cleveland.
          It looks as if it would again disre
          gard this same opposition, and nomi
          nate Parker.

          St. Louis, Ju ly 6.Exactly at noon
          Chairman J. K. Jones of the national
          committee called the democratic na
          tional convention to order. His ap
          pearance on the platform and the
          sou nd of his gavel brought forth a
          cheer from the floor and galleries.
          Chairman Jon es directed the ser
          geant-at-arms to secure order.
          continued belaboring the table with
          his gavel but it was some time before
          quiet reigned.
          the time the hall was one-third
          filled the heat had begun to increase
          to a noticeable degree. The great ma
          jority of the delegates and visitors had^
          provided themselves with fans and the
          auditorium viewed from the speakers
          desk was one yellow flutter, as th?
          palm-leaf fans bobbed back and forth.
          The delegates lost but little time in
          removing their coats, and the com
          plexion of the lower part of the hall,
          black at first, became lighter and
          lighter, as the ooats disappeared and
          the shirtsleeves became evident.
          The first ripple of applause that
          went across the convention came
          from the galleries when the Texas del
          egation marched In bearing their flag
          of red, white and blue, with the single
          star.
          A white silk banner beari ng the in
          scription* Florida democracy safe and
          sound, was borne into the hall short
          ly after the Texans had arrived, and
          was also greeted with applause.
          This was five minutes, before 12,
          and up to that time not a handolap
          had been offered to a ny man who had
          entered the hall. The platform was
          crowded with members of the national
          committe e, but the crowd paid no at
          tention to them.
          The Fhilippino delegation came in
          with their banner, which was not
          floating free like those that had
          tered before it. It was an American the cheers and cries fell, there would
          flag of Bilk wrapped closely arou nd
          the staff and tied hard and fast. This
          was done, aocordlng to one of the
          Philippine delegation, with deliber
          ate intent, as if to show that the
          democratic convention did not recog
          nize the Philippines as part of the
          nation.
          Chairman Guffy of Pennsylvania
          strode in closely behind t*ie Philippine
          flag and,WKs~1*eiR*trry

          Bryan Rose for a Cheer.
          Just as the California delegation
          reached its reservation after march
          ing up and down the center aisle, Wm.
          J. Bryan, who had come in unnoticed,
          arose in his place and was giv en a
          cheer. Then an enterprising member
          of the Montana delegation created a
          diversion by vigorously ringing a cow
          bell.
          Again Chairman Jones demanded
          that the conventi on be in order and at
          once directed the secretary to read the
          call for the convention.
          Applause followed the readi ng of
          the call. After quiet was restored,
          Chairman Jones announced that the
          convention would be opened by prayer
          by Rev. John Cannon, pastor of
          Grand Avenue Baptist church of S
          Louis.
          During the invocation the conven
          tion stood. Dr. Cannons voice was
          entirely inadequate to reach even the
          oenter of the hall. The prayer occu
          pied several minute s.
          Enthusiastio cheering greeted the
          chairman s announcement that he was
          directed by the national committee to
          appoint John Sharp Williams tem
          porary chairman and C. A. Walsh
          temporary secretary, and John Mar
          tin, temporary sergeant-at-arms.
          The chairman appoint ed Colonel J.
          M. Guffey of Pennsylvania and M.
          Harper of California to esoort Mr.
          Williams to the chair. A the plat
          form was inclosed by a railing, it
          was necessary for the committee
          and Mr. Williams to climb over the
          railing. The committee lifted Mr.
          Williams safely over and the entire
          conventi on burst into cheers as he
          ascended the platform.
          I have the honor to introduce to
          you John S. Williams as temporary
          chairman, said Chairman Jones, and
          again the convention cheered.
          Williams Speaks.
          Mr. Williams was attired in a light
          gray suit and awhite waistcoat.
          delivered his address calmly and with
          out gestures. Several cries of louder,
          louder, interrupted Mr. Williams as
          he began, his clear but not powerful
          voice at first failing to reach parts of
          the hall.
          A Williams proceeded, is
          voice increased in volume and the
          delegates listened attentively.
          Convention Amused.
          The convention appear ed consider
          ably amused at Mr. Williams humor
          ously sarcastic references to the mu-
          tual admiration society of Mr. Roose
          velt and Mr. Root, and when he read
          a eulogy by the president on Mr.
          Root, the delegates laughed and ap
          plauded.
          Mr. Willjpms spoke in an ironical
          tone that caught the fancy of the
          convention, and he was interrupted
          time and time aga in by laughter.
          Cheering was evoked by the speakers
          statement that Mr. Rooseve lt had
          found praise for only three presi
          dentsGeor ge Washington, Abraham
          Lincoln and himselfand when he
          asked if the hell-roaring Jake
          Smith order was a sample of the
          moral sentiment for which the repub
          licans stood, a lusty cheer broke forth.
          A great part of Mr. Williams
          speech was delivered under great dif
          ficulties, for the speak er and tho se
          of his heare rs who were suppos ed to
          be most directly interested in is re
          marks. The aisles leading past the
          delegates we re packed by dense
          throngs, who kept up a constant hum
          of conversation that smothered Mr.
          William s voice. Policemen who we re
          in the space arou nd the
          1stationed
          platform to keep others away, did it
          by occupying the space themselves to
          the exclusion of all others.

          times the speaker stopped and asked
          that the talking cease in order that
          he might make himself better under
          stood.
          Mr. Williams mentioned the name
          of Mr. Bryan in discussing the price
          of wheat during the first Bryan-Mo
          Kinley campaign. The utterance of
          the name called forth a little applause
          and some cheers. A second later
          mentioned the name again and the
          applause was not repeated.
          Cheer lor Cleveland.
          A mention of the name of Grove*
          Cleveland was cheered lustily. A mo~
          ment later the first scene of the ses-,
          sion occurred. Mr. Williams declared I
          that it was a brazen effrontery for the
          republican party to attempt to seize
          the laurels of Grover Cleveland. A
          genuine outburst of applause fo l
          lowed.
          Cheer after oheer rolled thru the
          hall, and altho the chairman used the
          gavel vigorously the convention was
          soon beyo nd his control. New Hamp
          shire delegates climbed upon their
          seats and yelled vigorously. One Iowa
          man of the Hearst-instructed delega
          tion from that commonwealth, stood
          up and waved his hat frantically, and
          a wild chorus answered him.
          Three chee rs for Grover Cleve-
          land, shouted an Alabama delegate,
          and they oame with genuine power
          and enthusiasm. N cry came from
          Nebraska, where Mr. Bryan and is
          friends sat. quietly, without taking
          part in the noise. Again and again
          the cheers came in dense volume, de
          spite numerous cries of order, and
          the strenuous pounding of the ohalr
          mans gavel.
          Then Mr. Williams sat back and
          watched the sce ne he had created. As,
          be a renewed outbreak and the dem
          onstration lasted eight minute s. f/^
          Brawl in Center.
          r&
          Tim Murphy of St. Louis, standing
          in the center aisle and encouraging
          the demonstration, was first requested
          to take his seat and then ejected from
          the hall by John I. Martin, sergeant
          at-arms. Murphy wa^jrushed towarde
          the platform byr Martin thru a railing
          and down a narrow-stairway leading
          omder th* ^tage. i
          Another encounter between Murphy*
          and Martin to ok place in the passage
          way under the stage. Murphy then
          permitt ed himself to be taken from
          the hall by two officers.
          Murphy said that he endeavored to
          assist in securing quiet, but his efforts
          were misunderstood, a,nd at the direc
          tion of Sergeant-at-Arms Martin he
          was forcibly ejected from the floor by
          a policeman, and landed among the
          newspaper men. Here he endeavored
          to explain that he had been acting in
          the interests of quiet and order, but
          his explanations fell on a deaf ear,
          and despite his expostulations and
          threats, he was finally taken from the
          building by the police in charge of
          Captain Schroeder.
          For several minutes after the Mur
          phy incident the demonstration con
          tinued. Finally, In desperation, Mr.
          Williams threaten ed to discontinue is
          speech.
          You have placed me here, I am
          your servant. If you dont want me
          to continue, it is your pleasure, he
          oried.
          This announcement was effective
          and Mr. Williams secured control, the
          demonstration that his mention of
          Cleveland had caused, dying slowly
          out.
          When he said that he had heard
          that Dewey, Schley and Miles were
          democrats, that a .republican admin
          istration had snubbed the first, tried to
          disgrace the second and insulted the
          third, the convention aga in broke out
          into shouts and applause.
          William s Voice Falling.
          this time Mr. Williams* voice
          was failing. It grew weaker and he
          was heard with difficulty even by
          those very near the platform.
          Mr. Williams flow of oratory was
          uninterrupted for some time. A re
          sponse of applause followed his de
          nunciation of the republican claims of
          prosperity because of the tariff. Cries
          of louder were again heard in various
          parts of the hall.
          I wish I had the lungs to speak
          louder, but I cannot, answered Mr.
          Williams.
          What did you say? came a voice
          from the gallery.
          So rapidly did the noise Increase
          that Mr. Williams began to address
          himself directly to the persons on the
          platform. This brought forth from
          the galleries loud cries of time and
          louder. Mr. Williams, with all the
          voice left, turned to the audience and,
          with considerable feeling, took up the
          race question. When he referred to
          the incident at the republican con
          vention when a colored child and
          white child were both on the plat
          form waving flags during one of the
          demonstrations, there we re cries of
          This is a white mans country! ~$0&
          Police Tried to Clear Aisles. g|
          So great did the noise become that
          the sergeant-at-arms went down into
          the hall and ordered the aisles
          cleared. But the police had difficulty
          in carrying out these instructions. Mr.
          Williams had by this time been speak
          ing an hour and twenty-five minutes.
          Now, a few words in conclusion,
          said Mr. Williams, and if you are as
          pleased to hear that conclusion as I
          am to conclude, this will be the most
          delighted audience that ever existed.
          Wiliams closed his speech at 2:05
          p.m.
          Mr. Williams devotes most of his
          speech to an arraignment of Presi
          dent Roosevelt, ex-Secretary Root and
          the republican party, chiefly by as
          sailing Mr. Roots speech as tempo
          rary chairman of the republican na
          tional convention, which, he says,
          was largely historical. Mr. Williams
          continued:
          It was to draw away attention from
          Rooseveltism and its volcanic, eruptive
          and reckless character by dwelling upon
          Several the fact that at some period of its history

          New York. Nov. .--Theodore
          Roosevelt was elected President
          yesterday for the term beginning
          March 4 next by an overwhelming
          majority in the electoral college and
          by a majority of the popular vote
          greater than that of any President in
          recent years.
          He carried every Northern and
          Western State, every doubtful State
          and everything but the so-called Solid
          South.
          He will have 325 electoral votes to
          151 for Judge Parker. Electoral
          majority for Roosevelt 174.
          His greatest plurality is in his own
          State- New York. At midninht the
          higures in hand indicated that he will
          have 2: .si votes more than Parker.
          His vote in Illinois. in Massachusetts
          and in most of the Western States
          was larger than that of McKinley in
          lipi. In every State.-that he carried
          he ran tylly as well as McKinley did
          four years ago.
          On the other hand. Judge Parker
          did not get as many votes in New
          York as Bryan did four years ago.
          and seems to have run behind the
          Bryan tote in all parts of the country.
          In 1872 the electoral vote was:
          Grant 292. Greeley and other Demo
          crats 74: Grants plurality 218.
          In 1892 it was: Cleveland 277. Harri
          son 1a5. Weaver Pop. 22: Cleve
          lauds plurality 112.
          In ln4i6 it was: McKinley 271. Bryan
          176, McKinleys plurality !g5.
          The Republicans retain control of
          the House of Representatives by an
          increased majority. The indications
          at midnight are that they will have
          from 20 to 230 members. They now
          have 210 members.
          It was apparent within an hour
          after the polls closed that Roosevelt
          had received a tremendous vote. As
          early as 61 oclock it was seen that his
          election was certain unless there
          should be some tremendous change.
          The returns at midnight indicate
          that about the bnly successes the.
          Democrats have had in the country
          are in West Virginia, Massachusetts
          and Minnesota. They elected their
          Governors in each of these States,
          although the Republicans carried
          them by increased majorities for, the
          electoral ticket.
          In most of the States where United
          States .senatorships were at stake the
          Republicans have elected their Legis
          latures. The Senators elected to
          begin their six-year terms on March 5,
          1905, will practically be in the same
          proportion as to party atlliatiod as
          those now sitting, thus continuing the
          Republican control of the Senate.
          At midnight William J. Bryan
          claimed Nebraska for the fusion can
          didate for Governor. This probably
          means that a fusion legislature has
          been elected. Bryan made his cam
          paign in Nebraska in the hope of secur
          ing the Legislature and his election to
          the United States Senate.
          In Wisconsin Gov. La Follette was
          elected over the Democratic and
          stalwart or bolting Republican can
          didates. The result on the Legislature
          is in doubt at midnight. Unless La
          Follete carries the Legislature he will
          not be able to put his taxation theories
          into effect.
          President Roosevelt announced at
          u oelock that under no hreuamstapees
          wi be be a eaadldste tavelection
          in loR. rThis leaves the held open to
          the many Republicans who have pre
          sidental asjpirations, including Vice
          President-elect FairbanKs. Senator
          Foraker and Secretary Taft of Ohio.
          Secretary Sliaw of Iowa and C-ove
          La Follette of Wisconsin.
          There are au few returns as yet on
          Sociali4t and Populist vote. W Vat-on
          ran exceedingly well in some part
          of the South. hut most of his exlpeted
          strength in New York seems to have
          gone to Roosevelt.
          Debs, the Socialist candidate, re
          ceived 45.4tt votes in Chicago and
          was heavily supported in many of the
          cities. It is expected that his vote
          will approximate half a million.
          The election of Douglas, Democrat
          ic candidate for Govereor in Mass
          achusetts. was the greatest surprise
          in the East. Douglas received :14.1:1

avlatrlces plural of avlatrix, of which
the masculine Is aviator, or shall we
adopt the suggestion of an English
magazine and refer to the fair fliers as
""aeroine*?"" The latter suggestion hits
merit, but the word has one fatal de
fect—It is difficult of pronunciation.
From some mouths it will emerge' with
so close a resemblance to ""heroines""
as to be mistaken for that word. Per
haps it is well to suggest a relation
ship between ""heroine"" and ""aero

worthy of enrollment in the lists of
the former. At this, stage of the flying

the prospect that a Wright machine will
be kept at Belmont Park for the sum
mer, for the instruction of students and
the carrying of passengers. These ad
vantages will make it possible for many
women to become aviators; and will also
give an opportunity to scores of others
who have been longing for a chance to
try the experiment as passengers.
The first woman to try to fly her own
machine was Miss Harriet Quimby, New
York journalist. She is very enthusias
tic over her monoplane, in which she has
already taken several long lights, with
but one mishap of minor importance.
Other women who have made several
flights alone at Mineola, are Mrs. E.
Edwards and Mrs. Francois Raiche.
Miss Mary Shea, winner of the Bridge
port Conn. Post competition, made a
flight of about five miles on May 14,
from the Bridgeport Aerodrome, .out

Mrs. Frank Coffyn, whose husband is
connected with the Wright Company's
instruction camp at Augusta, Ga., flew
30 miles with her husband on March 3,
from Augusta, Ga., to Aiken, S. C. They
left the former place at 7:10, arriving
at their destination at 8:21, just in time
to eat breakfast with some friends.
Most of the time, they traveled at a
height of 500 feet.
Across the water, are many French
women aviators who have won trophies
in various contests. Among these may
be named Mile. Hervieu, who won the
Coupe Ftmina at Pau in 1910, traversing
eighty-seven miles and remaining in the
air two hours and five minutes, and
Baroness Raymonde de Laroche, who
was one of the first airwomen in France.

while giving no detailed description of
the machine, she said it called for a
spread of forty-five feet, with a width
of seven feet. The plane was to stand
six feet in height and to weigh several i
hundred pounds less than any other I
aeroplane of the time. The engine was I

Miss Todd not only designs her aero
planes, but. being skilled in the use
of tools, is her own model builder.
It is believed that Miss Catherine
Wright, sister of the Wright brothers,
was the first American woman to make
a flight in an aeroplane. This she did

They are the naftural avia
tors. -N
History repeats itself. Men by the
score will Have died the death in
the air before aerial navigation is
safe. Then w oraan, the- cautious, the
conservative, the primitive, will step
in and rale.
Why is the air woman's own do
main? The answer is perfectly
'plain to both psychologists and
physiologists.
The periphery, the outer rim of
a woman's retina, Is as sensitive to
objects as is Its centre. A woman
can look- away from you and still
see you.
Her arc of sight is almost twice
that of man's, in whom, as a rale,
the periphery of the retina is ex
tremely blunted to impressions. Try
the experiment of having a woman
look straight ahead and telling you
how much she still can see on each
'Bide of her without directly looking
at the objects.
There is a deep psychological rea
son for this. Primitive man, who,
surrounded by dangers, had to keep
looking on every side at once, had,
it is probable, almost periscopic
sight, such as the birds have. He
could never know what side d&Bgss,
was coming from, and so eves
though looking ahead, his retina,
sensitised to the rims, caught Im
pressions necessary to warn him of
enemies or of game.
Ever since woman has been the
subject of man she has practised
modesty. Sh has been forced to
go along with downcast eyes. And
yet her coqeettry has enforced upon
her the necessity of seeing. The
accomplished flirt has the peripheral
sensitiveness to the maximum but
every woman has it more or less.
Walking with averted eyes for fear
of husband or lover, she still sees
every male and female that goes
by her. She has retained this primi
tive retinal faculty.
By experiments at Harvard and
Vienna and at Paris, a woman's
arc of sight has been, measured.
The accompanying diagram shows
its relation to man's and to the
bird's. Manifestly the sight, which
more closely approaches the peris
copic, is better adapted for flying,
else a blrd would net have de
veloped this sight. A twig moving
far to his right in his field of vision
may be the signal of a hidden
enemy to the bird; in the same way

No Place in the Air for Women
By Claude Grahame-White,
I HAVE taught many women to fly and
I regret it My. experience has taught
me that the air is no place for a
woman.
When calamity overtakes my women pu
pils, as sooner or later I fear it will, I
shall feel in a way responsible for their
sodden decease.
I have often taken ray. mother and my
sister in the air as passengers. They un
derstand aviation thoroughly. But I would
never let them fly alone.
The truth Is that women lack qualities
which make for safety in aviation. They
are temperamentally unfitted for the sport
Bravery and courage are not essential
in aviation. Supreme confidence in one's
self a Women may possess the former,
but they generally lack the latter Safety

tied,"" If I may use the word, no matter
what happens. Men sometimes possess this
faculty, but It Is very rare In women.
Professor Hensingmuller may be correct
In his premises, but the conclusions he
draws from them are not sustainable.
Thus women may possesa a greater
range of vision than men, although I have
never heard the proposition advanced be
fore, but that will not make them better
aviators, for a greater range of vision is
not needed. The aviator has all he can do
to look straight ahead, and the power to
see further to the right and left would
prove at all serviceable.
Gusts of wind and currents aTe not vis
ible. As a matter of fact their presence
can usually be felt long before they affect
the planes. Woman's superior vision
would therefore be of no value to her In
that respect
It Is said also that women have greater
tuition than men. That may be so', but I
I.do not think that the kind of Intuition
they possess Jn such abundance would be
of any practical use in aviation.
Diffused attention, too, would be mtre
xof a handicap than an advantage. What
the aviator needs more than anything else
is the ability to concentrate his mind on his
levers.
It is true that women are lighter than
men. It is equally true, however, that
weight will be of no conseouence In the
aeroplane of the f utare, except perhaps that
the greater the weight the more effective
will be the aeroplane. The future aero
plane will be of steel wood and canvas
will be eliminated.
As far as woman's milder manner ot
sneezing Is concerned I cannot see how
that will be of advantage. In view of the
fact that, in my own experience, I have
never found It necessary to sneeze at all
while In the air.
I do not believe that aviation increases
the. tendency to sneeze, nor shouM I con
sider it of the slightest Importance even if
it did. It takes considerably more than a
sneeze to wreck an aeroplane, or even to
disconcert an aviator.
The sense of balance comes to the avia
tor naturally. One elevates or lowers his
planes almost Instinctively, the same as
one turns the handle-bars in bicycling or
varies the stroke in swimming or tennis.
In these instantaneous motions there Is no
time for consideration. Instinct takes the
place of foresight. I do not think that
women are better equipped in this respect
than men. t is rather a matter of experi
ence than natural fitness.
ftls true that with one or two excep
tions women aviators have so far escaped
serious accidents, it must be remembered
however, that their efforts have been con
fined exclusively to aerodrome flights
which is a very different proposition to
cross-country work and the hazardous
achievements undertaken by men.
When the airship becomes absolutely
safe, lis It will, women may make good
aviators, but they will never dominate the

Woman Aviator, Who Has Been
Made a Chevalier pf the Legion of

MLLH. HBLENB DUTRIEU, the ""Hawk
Girl of Franco,"" has just been made
a Chevalier of the Legion of Honor
as a reward for her skill as an aviator. Mile.
Dutrieu Is one of few women to receive this
decoration.
France has g,lven it to her because the Bu
reau of War has become convinced that
women make better aviators than men, and
so, In Its struggle to perfect Its aeroplane
Bervlce, wishes to encourage women to enter
that field of action!
The great ambition of the French Is to keep
far ahead of all other nations In aviation.
The belief that the victories of the future
will 'belong to those who aro strongest In
the air has becomo firmly Ingrained in the
national mind. Therefore, France Is spend
ing more than any other nation on this
branch of service and is making extended
and varied researches into the problems and
possibilities of aviation. In the course of
these experiments, not long ago, a series of
tests were made to determine the effects of
altitude and speed on tho human body and to
test the reactions under the conditions of
flvlnit Both men and women were used in
the experiments, and when the results were
tallied It was found that the woman had far
outstripped the men on all Points'
Other experiments were made and the ex
perts in charge, as a result, have come to
the surprising conclusion that woman make
n much better aeroplane drivers than do
men that In the future she will literally rule
thThelr'report of the scientists to the -Var
Department, as cabled from Paris, gives eight
controlling factors for this supremacy:
First Because woman is more primitive
than man.
Second Her nerves are not so delicate,
and so she is less nervous.
Third she feels pain less than man does.
Fourth She needs less oxygen In her
br?fth The arc of her sight Is nearly double
that of man. A
Sixth She has tho faculty of ""diffused at
tention,"" which man ordinarily lacks.
Seventh That her specific gravity Is less
than man's and that the slight differences
in her skeletel structure givo her an enor
mous advantage in the air over her heavier,
more compact mate.
Eighth That her sneeze is less violent.
Tho perfect aviator, says tho report, am
plifying these points, needs not nerve, but
comparative nervolcssnoss. The possession
of what is called ""nerve"" implies a psycho
logical conflict In which courage is continu
ally overcoming fear. The truly courageous
man is ho who fears something mightily, but
who goos on and fights in spite of his fear.
The man who ""never knew what fear Is"" Is
not truly courageous, In tho higher sense,
because It does not requlro courage to fight
something of which wo nro not afraid.
The ""hlghor courage"" is positively detri
mental to tho aviator, tho experimenters say,
because the psychological conflict between
""nerve"" and fear uses up energy and koops
the aviator at a tension which does not al
low tho highest efficiency as a flier. Conse
quently, the typo that makes the perfect avi
ator is the one that is nerveless, who has no
conception of fear and faces tho perils of the
air courageously because ho does not recog
nize that there are any perils.
Woman, it was found, has this quality to
a surprising degree. She has It because she
Is still the primitive sex, has doveloped less
than man, not only physlologlqally, but psy
chologically. Back In a far distant age man and
woman were almost equally nerveless. But
man's activities caused him to acquire finer
and more delicate nerves. Ho has steadily
become more nervous and more sensitive to
pain. This incapacitates him for tho con
quest of the air, while woman's lack in these
respects fits her for it.
The comparative Insensibility to pain is
important because many an aviator has
dropped to death because tho stinging cold
of the upper altitudes has caused him, mo
mentarily, to lose control of his machine.
Again, in driving an aeroplane, the avi
ator's position is more nearly quadrupedal
than in any other form of locomotion. The
aviator almost literally flies on all fours. Ho
does this because ho can attain the best
balance in this position. Here the same
prlmltlveness which gives woman the lead
in nervelcssness also comes to her aid. Sho
is of structure more nearly the quadruped
than-1b man. It is more natural and easier
for her to drop on all fours and she can get
about more freely In that posture than man

airship pilot than the breast of tho Missis
sippi is to the steamboat pilot and Mark
Twain has told of their complexities. The
peripheral sensitiveness of woman enables
her to see these signs whero man's concen-
can. Dr. Havelock Ellis makes the assertion trated sight misses them
that the realization that woman ""is still an
atomically a quadruped Is the greatest sur
gical triumph of the nineteenth century."" In
this connection he defended woman's use of
the corset, saying that it !s needed to keep
organs designed by nature for a horizontal
position, In a vertical one.
Man having learned what woman haB only
Imperfectly learned, to stand upright, needs
no corset. This quadrupedal tendency, to
gether with the fact that her bones aro
lighter and she has less specific gravity than
man, aids her In flying, as It does in swim
ming. When timidity does not restrain them
women are much better Bwlmmers than men.
The field of woman's sight is larger than
man's. The report states it thus: ""The arc
of a woman's vision is nearly twice that of
man."" In other words, while man, trained
to concentrate his sight upon one object, sees
with only a limited part, tho centre, of the
retina of his eye, woman, through centuries of
slde-glanclng habits, of looking, so to speak,
out of the tall of her eye, hw kept the faculty
of sight throughout tho periphery of her re
tina. While looking straight ahead she can
see what la happening at either side of her
and for a short distance behind her. This
power she shares with the savage and most
of the lower animals the rabbit and she be
ing about equal in this respect.
The faculty Is enormously valuable In tho
air. Graham-White, among others, has Bald
that it is of the utmost Importance to the
aviator to be able to see every change in the
skies above him and the land about him.
Trees moving in a breeze far to the left may
be a danger signal, which will mean disaster
to the airman it not heeded. So of changes
in clouds. The country under and the air
about are filled with more slcns to the perfect
In tho same way what the late great
psychologist, William James, called her,
""dispersed attention,"" helps her. Man's ad
vancement has developed in him a tremen
dous power of concentration. This his primi
tive spouse, or sister, lacks. Man concen
trates his attention. Woman scatters hers.
Man thinks of one thing at a time. Woman
tries to think of many things nt the samo
moment and succeeds. Tho span of conscious
ness Is wider in woman even if it Is .shallower.
Consuming less oxygen than man she 1b a
shallower breather she Is loss affecod by
the thin air of high altitudes.
For theao and other reasons cited In tho

Dr. Lessor's statement follows:
Why HOME-LOVING Woman is the Best Air Woman
By Dr. A. Monae Lesser.
Former Chief Surgeon of the Ped Cross
of America.
THERE is truth in the contention that
woman because of her primitive
qualities may yet rule the air. But
tho type of woman who will do so is the
quiet, stay-at-home woman tho housekeeper,
housewife and mother.
That it should be she, the woman of the
hearth, Instead of the woman ot public ac
tion, is capable of Bclontlflc proof. Since
the dim ages of the world, when men and
women were of equal prlmltlveness, man
has developed far, and a penalty ot his
mighty concentration has been an acute ten
sion of the nervous system and a correspond
ing seusltiveneBs to pain.
If men were called upon to bear the pain
that i'j visited upon women, especially in
maternity, they would suffer doubly, and
many of them would die. Even lesser pains
ordinarily borne by women would send
them running about the house screaming.
They could not enduro what women bear
because women have a greater capacity for
suffering. All this is due to their: greater
nerve tension, which has come with their
greater advanco from prlmltlveness.
Tho greater nerve tension haB produced
a different kind of nerves. Scattered
through the membranes of their bodies are
nerves of a finer, more delicate order. Men
sneeze more violently than women because
in the membrane lining of the noao are a
finer grade of nerves, more delicate, moro
sensitive to intruding dust or to changes of
temperature.
The woman who has developed along
lines of domesticity has little or no such
nervous sensitiveness. Her sensibilities are
coarser, because they have never been de
veloped to the knlfo-llko edge of man's. It
is not, according to some aeronauts Claude
Graham White, I bellevo among them not
nerve, but lack of nervousness, that makes
great aeronauts, Nervousness during an
ascent Is fatal. That state which we term

Lady Victoria Pery, the Prettiest
of the Bold English Airwomen
A London, Oct. 2."">.
PROPOSAL lias been made to or
ganize a corps of women aviators
to servo with the allied armies of
England and Prance, now lighting the
Germans.
The idea Jsas oeon received with en
thusiasm by many women, who reject the
ancient theory of feiyinine weakness and
declare that their sex is fully as lit to t'aee
peril as the men.
The aviators have proved themselves
one of the most valuable factors in the
war. There is a great need of more of
them, and it* is impossible to train them in
a hurry. This Is one of the strongest
reasons urged in favor of using the many
skilled women aviators in the lighting.
The suggestion has actually appeared in
print that Lady Victoria May Pery, daugh
ter of the Earl of Limerick, i.hould become
chief of a British royal feminine flying
corps.
Lady Victoria is 0*e of the most dashing
jidJ certaluly the prettiest of English
women aviators. She was trained in avia
tion by Graharae White and the late, Gnstav
Hamel. in whoso company she ""looped the
loop"" in al most daring manner. Mantel
was eventually killed while doing this
trick.
It is not likely, however, that Lady Vic
toria will take the suggestion and join the
fighting aviation corps, for she has gone
to the United States and there become the
bride of Mr. James C. Brady. We have
probably not yet reached the point where
a bride will interrupt, her honeymoon to
go off to the war, aft^r the fashion of the
German submarine captain who left his
bride of the before to steam away and
blow up three British warships.
There are, however, plenty of English
women and French women without en
cumbrances who are ready to fight in the
air corps.
Why should not women serve as military
aviators? They have the courage and the
skill. They have the patriotism. If they
are inferior in weight ahd muscle to men,
these qualities are not of the first im
portance to the aviator. In steadiness and
nerve, which are the essential qualities in
the air, the modern girl claims to be fully
the equal of her brother.
?Is it contrary to the principles of civiliza
tion and humanity to expose gentle women
to physical hardships and the horrors of
war? This argument has largely been dis
posed of in recent discussions. Women are
employed in all sorts of occupations that
shorten and endanger life.
It has now been proved' that in every
war many women have fought, very'cred
itably, In spite of all rules against their par
ticipating. Many women took part in the
last. Balkan war, and it fs already certain
that a considerable number of French
women ere now fighting.
Women are freely risking their lives
with the Red Cross forces and as nurses
in other* organizations at the front. Many
W of these nurses have already been
killed, and there is little doubt that
oth??rK will be. N'o one seems to have
any strong objection to the employ
ment of women nurses at the front.
Tim prejudice is-not-against their
risking their lives, but against their
becoming combatants.
[?*rom all this It appears clear that If
conventional restrictions were removed
there would be a very great number of
effective women combatants.
And if they are to fight, why not in the
air. where their nerve and daring would
be of most value?
One of the most daring of women avia
tors is Mademoiselle Helene Dutrieu. of
France. She was the first woman to per-,
form the loop-the-loop trick, that ""death
defying stunt that made men's blood stand
s;ill when they first saw a man do it
.Mademoiselle Dutrieu did it as coolly and
cleverly as any man.
.She is a tall, siender girl with an ex
quisite figure, as supplfc as a bamboo and
as strong as steel.
She,has carried a man passenger very
ot\en. and is therefore well qualified for
war aviation, in which two persons in a
machine are almost a necessity.
Mademoiselle Dutrit?V received the
Legion of Honor decoration for her ex
ploits. She would undoubtedly make a
daring leader of fighting aviators.
Among the many brilliant French air
women arr Madame Francis, Mademoiselle
Julienne Marehnl, the Baroness Raymonde
do la Roche, Mademoiselle Marvingt- and
Mademoiselle Valentine Duels.

At St. Petersburg she .flew over the city

She flew over Budapest', in Hungary
In one of her first attempts she came
near having a faial accident, and many
people thought the experience would rob
her of her nerve completely. She was
t arried by the wind over a clump-of trees.
She did her best to avoid them with a swift
turn of the aeroplane rudder, but the ma
chine, rushing through the air at express
train speed, touohed the topmost branches,
and with a whirling crash it came sweep
ing to the ground and was wrecked irre
trievably.
Instantly the spectators rushed to the
spot, expecting to pick up the body of
the aviator, but the Baroness extricated
herself from the debris qtiiie unhurt and
not at all frightened. Indeed, she laughed
at the startled faces about Iter and said
calmly:
""An uncomfortable experience, it is true,
but I rather expected it.""
The next day she was in the air again
with a new machine.
Mademoiselle Marvingt began her train
ing with two men, Wnchter and Laffont,
who were subsequently killed. This did
not daunt her, and she went, on and won
a cup for flying women.'
Miss Eleanor Trehawko Davies has the
reputation of being the i\ij>st daring of
English aviatric.es. She has flown across
the 'English Channel several times.\On

Miss Spencer Kavanagh has aiso-dis

Kananagh has also been a sportswoman,
having hunted, broken horses, driven auto

contests. She wished to learn to fly as
soon as it became known that it was a

First?Because woman is more primitive
than man.
Second?Her nerves are not so delicate,
and so she. is less nervous.
Third?she feels pain less than man
does.
Fourth?She needs less oxygen in-her
breathing.
Fifth?The arc of Iter sight is nearly
double that of man.
Sixth?She lias the faculty of ""diffused

Seventh?That her specific gravity is
less than man's, and that the slight differ

enormous advantage in the tfir over her
.heavier, more compact mate.
Eighth?That her sneeze is less violent.
""The perfect aviator.*' says the doctor's
report, amplifying those points, ""needs, not
nerve, but comparative nervelessness. The
possession of what is called 'norvo' implies
a psychological conflict in which courage
is continually overcoming fear. The truly
courageous man is lie who fears something
mightily, but who goes on and fights in
spite of his fear. The man* who 'never
know what fear is' is not truly courageous
in the higher sense, because it does not re
quire courage to fight, something of* which
we ?re not afraid.
""The 'higher courage.' is positively detri
mental to the aviator, because the psy
chological conflict between ?nerve"" and fear
uses u| energy and keeps the aviator at a
tension which does not allow the highest
efficiency as a flier. Consequently tin; type
that uiakes the .perfect aviator is the one
that is nerveless, who has no conception
of fear, and faces the perils of tlic air
courageously because ho does not recog
nize that there are any perils.

'""The comparative insensibility to pain

the exotic charm of a dead pallor,
which only goes to emphasize her
large and expressive oyei. You
might Justly mistake her for an

She Is not regularly enrolled In
the army, and, though she gladly
would die for her country, she has
no desire to become a soldier. That
the government receives her ser
vices unofficially gives her no of
fence at all. She fully agrees with
the Frenchman's point of view on
the sex question.
""He does not want his wife to
fight,"" she explains. ""He will not
permit her life to be endangered.
He will not be responsible for her
death. Not that the French woman
Is not brave. All women are brave
when the lives of their dear ones

more emotional. Ah, people now.
Just because of this war, are be
ginning to understand the character
of the French woman as she really

In their true colors.""
Gave Warning Thrice.
Mile. Dutrleu would make you
believe that some of the perils
through which she passed In times
of peace far overshadow thoso of
the war period, and laughs when
khe quotes a report that her duty
was to cnase away the raiding Ger
man taubes that dropped bombs
upon Paris. ""All I did was to fly
up when I suspected that the Ger
man airmen were coming,"" she ex
plained, ""and, then, if I observed
the enemy approaching, return and
report to the men, who immediately
rose to give battle or chase to the
Intruder.""
When word was flashed to Paris,
Che boarded her aeroplane and took
to the skies, mounting in spirals
iilsfter and hlghc* until the plane
looked the size of a soaring dragou
fly. Then courageously would she
fly In the direction of the expectod
danger, circling round, rising and
descending with eyes kf-ou to the
Quest and nerves as steady as the
snetal of the mechanism that held
her afloat above the city. from the
streets of which thousands turned
their faces upward to watch, not
for the hostile taubes as much a3
to watch, adinlre and marvel at the
Intrepid ""Girl Hawk.""
Three times when the Germans
were advancing on Paris did she
give warning of their approach, her
swift monoplane affording her a
long advantage over the enemy.
""There was no danger,"" she says
simply. But there Is always danger
even the lay public knows, the fact
being emphasized by the peaceful
accident which ended the life of
the young Englishman, the first to
destroy a Zeppelin, who, after tak
ing part In the greatest of aerial
war achievements and escaping as
by a miracle, was dashed to death
when in the act of taking up an
American correspondent for an ex
hibition flight. Keen as are the
eyes of Mile. Dutrieu and skilled as
she is in the operation of her craft,
there was always the possibility of
sudden and unexpected onslaught
from the hostile craft; then there
was the peril which is always at
the elbow of those who adventure
Into the skies.
Bruges Chimed Her Honors.
She had already fallen from a
house during an accident in Odessa
and escaped without serious hurt.
Her monoplane had turned turtle
with her at Issy-les-Mollneaux and
she escaped only with a severe
shaking up, having been saved by
the upper stays of the machine.
She has had many another close
call. Always glad to escape the
discussion of the graver aspects of
the work, especially as it conce'rns
herself. Mile. Dutrieu very soberly
says that she felt one of the great
est elatlons c? her life when she
flew high above the historical belfry
of I-.es Halles at Bruges, celebrated
by Longfellow.
As the people wildly cheered In
the streets, the bells pealed out in
her honor whlJe she circled above
the structure and then flew back to
Ostend, carrying a passenger. But
no greater and yet scarcely justifled
apprehension did she ever reel,
looking into the face of danger and
sudden death, than that which
seized her when, on her arrival at
Ostend, she had to be protected
from a joyously hysterical crowd
bent on kissing and embracing her!
The record of this incident tells
us that: ""The mayor and all the
officers of the city led In the shower
of congratulations that fell upon
Mile. Dutrieu. The men became
even more hysterical even than tho
women, gesticulating and shrieking
like mad?stirred to uncontrollable
laughter and tears, stretching their
hands toward her. Thus they
pressed around the girl and the
flying machine. And so she had to
be protected?so many desired to
kiss her.""
She was the first woman to fly
Into Belgium. Two officers only
had done so before her. And over
the air lanes that she sailed in her
journey of a new achievement, now
speed swift, sinister things of the
air that spit singing death through
the void and on the earth below, or
drop thunderous destruction as
they pass swiftly through the night.
""Nervous?"" she repeated the
query, smiled and was silent for a
moment. ""My friend, one must
not be nervous la the upper air, or
one, will never go there again. The
true aviator must be without nerves.'
She'a a Homing Bird.
""Of course, I'd much rather fly
than vote,"" she continued; ""though
you doubtless thluk it would be
well for a woman, having accom
plished the one thing to seek to
achieve the other. A woman may
rty a-id be at the same time a hom
ing bird by Instinct?this the view
as concerns myself, of course. You
""Then courageously would she fly in the direction of the expected danger, circling around, rising

see, therefore, I am not a suffra
gette. I think woman has all she
can do and all she should do, If she
is a home-maker and a good moth
er. And the French, husband thinks
so, too.
""As for voting, that would be an
Impossible situation in France.
The French women,"" and her
shapely hands fluttered prettily,
""are too emotional and excitable.
So, too. are our men. It can easily
be seea that they very likely would
become so excited over the issues
that life would be made utterly un
bearable.""
The flrst woman air scout became
interested in flying about eight
years ago. and, noting her youthful
appearance now, one estimates that
the must have been a slip of a girl
when the fusillading motor sent th*
earth away from beneath her for

In Her Forthcoming Book She Will Tell Ail About the Horrors of the Cuban Campaign as She and Her Assistants Saw It, and Wall Score the War Department.
IN her forthcoming book on the history of the Red Cross So
ciety, a review of whose preliminary chapters has already ap
peared in the New York Sunday Herald, Miss Clara Barton will
give to the world a thrilling— almost a grewsome— narrative
of official mismanagement. Through the courtesy of the pub
lishers the advance sheets of those newer portions of the work
that deal with the Cuban campaign are here reviewed. The state
ments are Miss Barton's, and will appear over her own name in
the volume to be issued next month.
It must remain for the War Investigation Commission to lay
the blame for the shameful mismanagement she describes on the
proper shoulders. Every candid reader will rise from the perusal
of the book with the fixed impression that had it nut been for the
aid cheerfully extended by the Red Cross and grudgingly accepted
by the military authorities, the loss of life and health at Siboney
and Santiago would have been well nigh unparalleled in the history
of modern warfare.
The publishers of the book are the American National Red
Cross at Washington, D. C.
IN reviewing Miss Barton's forth
coming book I must necessarily
pass over much that is Interesting
about the beginning of the Red
18 campaign in Cuba and the
official stumbling blocks placed in the
society's way, and come down to the
.Bltuatij-in just previous to the destruc
tion of the Maine. At this time Miss
■Barton was already well established in
r.Cuba, and was dispensing relief at

Explosion of the Maine.
It. was before this good work was well
In-hand that the explosion of the Maine
■'occurred. Miss Barton describes how;
on th/> memorable February 15. the
clerical work to be dono was so heavy
..that it kept herself and Mr. Elwell, her
.'lnterpreter and secretary, busy at
tjieir writing table until late at nicht.
""The house had grown still, the
'ibises' on the streets were dying away,
..'When suddenly the table shook from

on the veranda, facing the
i-^a, flew open; everything in the room

of light,' and this, in turn, filled witn
black specks like huge epeters flying
in all directions.
""Then it faded away. The bells ran*,
the whistles blew and voices In the
street were heard for a moment. Then
all was quiet again. I supposed it to
be the bursting of some mammoth mor
tar or explosion of some magazine. A
few hours later came the terrible news
of the Maine.""
Some forty of the wounded were
brought ashore and placed in the Span
ish hospital of San Ambrosio. All the
jni'mbers of the Red -ross hurried to
th ir relief.

Upon the advice of the Consul Gen
eral at Havana the lied Cross retired
when the President recalled all Ameri
cans home. The day before they ]*-f t
Cuba the Archbishop of Havana pub
licly blessed the Lee Orphanage in the
presence of a large crowd. In the eyes
Of nil Catholics, Cuban and Spanish
alike, this blessing was a symbol of
protection by the church and a warrant
of success. Hence Miss Barton was not
surprised to lea-rn several months after
the war had begun that the Spanish
authorities had not only taken the most
scrupulous care of the hospital, but
had also placed a guard around her
former private residence.
Return to Key Weet.
On April 11, 1898, Miss Barton and her
staff! boarded the ship Olivette and after
a great deal of discomfort caused by
overcrowding of passengt s and stormy
weather, reached Tampa, Fla., two daya
later. Leaving the rest of the party at
Tampa, Miss Barton proceeded to
Washington with Drs. Hubbell and
Egan. The Red Cross agents left in
Florida found work enoug-h to hand in
looking after the 1500 Cuban refugees In
Tampa and the 800 or 900 in Key West.
These people were almost entirely de
pendent for a period of some seven
months upon the good offices of the Red
Cross agents.
In the meantime Miss Barton, in
Washington, also had her hands full.
Early in April it had been decided by
the Cuban Relief Committee in New
York to charter a steamer in that port,
load her with supplies and send her
to different ports in Cuba, where her
cargo could be unloaded in such quanti
ties as might be required.
The steamer Btate of Texas was ac
cordingly selected. Notwithstanding the
departure of the Red Cross party from
Havana and the subsequent declaration
of war with Spain the preparations
were kept up and the steamer was load
ed with a cargo embracing a fine as
sortment of necessaries and delicacies,
medicine and other hospital stores. She
arrived at Key West on April 28, and
was met by Miss Barton, who had come
down from Washington, and all the
Red Cross assistants who had been left
in Tampa.
Key West at that time was a very
busy place, the harbor being filled with
naval vessels which came in daily from
the Cuban blockade squadron for coal
and provisions. There was scarecly
a day that some accident did not hap
pen to sailor or workman. The Red
Cross doctors were at all times in de
mand. In order to keep every one in
the best preparation for possible con
tingencies those on board the State of
Texas were instructed and drilled in
the various phases of their particular
work, and at all times of the day the
Red Cross boat, with its well known
flag floating, could be seen going from
one transport to another on Its errand
of mercy.
Prisoners Left to Starve.
There were other charities which
clamored for the attention of the Red
Crocs officials. Scarcely a day passed
that Borne of the blockading squadron
did not bring into Key West from one
to three captured prizes— ships, schoon
ers, steamers or fishing smacks. With
in a couple of weeks after the declara
tion of war there were between thirty
and forty of these boats lying at an
chor in the harbor with their crews
aboard under guard. Somehow it was
forgotten these poor foreigners must
eat to live! Or perhaps somebody
thought that somebody else was re
sponsible for this very important mat
ter.
At all events, when the small amount
of provisions aboard the boats at the
time of capture had been exhausted,
calls were made on the United States
Marshal for additional food. Having
no contingent fund upon which to draw,
and knowing the quantities of red tape
that must be unraveled before he could

secure any relief, the Marshal came
to Miss Barton with his troubles. That
good lady reassured him by promising
to provide for all the prisoners until
such time as he could Ret his petition
through the circumlocution office.' Sev
eral boatloads of provisions were hasti
ly gathered and taken in tow by a
steam launch, which landed them
alongside of each prize.
Miss Barton visited every boat in per
son, learned the wants of the crews
through an Interpreter, and not only
supplied all needed foods, but ar
ranged to take all letters and forward
them to their destination through the
intermediary offices of the Red Cross at
Portugal.
Could Not Reach Reconcentrados.
On.' June 20, everything being in read-*
mess, and no disapproval having been
elicited from the Navy Department, it
was decided to sail and find Sampson's
fleet near Santiago de Cuba, Here it
was generally believed that General
Shafter would try to effect a landing.
On the 25th the State of Texas arrived
off Morro. Castle, at the entrance of
Santiago Bay. The Spanish flag was
flying over the land fortifications and
Sampson's fleet was stationed in the
adjacent waters.
Miss Barton sent a 'representative
aboard I the flagship New York asking
Rear Admiral Sampson for instructions.
Word was returned that General Sh.af
ter's army had disembarked at Bai
quiri, a point about twelve miles east
if Morro Castle. The admiral advised
Miss Barton to take her ship to Guan
tanamo.Bay, where she would find good
anchorage and calm water, and where
she would be able to learn more of
ivhat was taking v place on land, as
there was constant communication
from there with the invading army.
rho Texas accordingly drew away and
irrived that evening at Playa del Este,
lust inside the mouth of Guantanamo
F3ay and some forty miles from Santi
igo.
Here two reporters from New York
japers called. on Miss; Barton, inform
ng her that' they had Just come in
Crom Siboney, where there was great
leed of supplies and medical aid. They
old how, many of the wounded in the
Ight between the Rough Riders and the
Spaniards, on the previous Friday, had
iust been brought in and were suffer
ng from lack of everything in the way
if comfort and conveniences. The
steamer was at once headed westward
md started to the scene of suffering,
which she reached at 8 o'clock.
A party of doctors accomplished a
difficult 'landing' in an open boat and
found their way to the army hospital.
This was a rough wooden building
which had evidently been used for a
store and warehouse in more peaceful
times. The surgeon in charge, Major
Havard, stepped forward to greet the
visitors, who formally offered him. in
the name of Clara Barton and the Red
Cross, the personal; services of all their
doctors and nurses and any of their
supplies that might be needed. These
were courteously refused. Major Hav
ard thought that .he and his assistants
would be able to take care of all the
3ick and wounded, and, as for supplies,
lie knew that there was an abundance
of them on the transports, which he
hoped would be landed next day.","April 11, 1898 :	Barton sets off to Cuba to help the injured during the Cuban insurrection."

New York, Feb. 1. Replying to
the recent letter of the President's
secretary, George B. Cortelyou, re
questing that public announcement
be made that the President of the
United States and his Cabinet can
not serve as a board of consultation
of the American National Red
Cross, .Miss Clara Barton, president
of the association, has addressed' an
explanatory letter to President
Roosevelt. Referring to article four
of tho constitution of the Red Cross,
providing for a board of consulta
tion, consisting of the President and
his Cabinet and certain high offi
cers of the army, Miss Barton points
out that this provision was full
endorsed by President Arthur and
his entire -cabinet, and accepted by
succeeding administrations. Con
tinuing Miss Barton writes:
""I recite these facts to you, Mr.
President, as an earnest that neither,
was usurpation practiced nor dis
courtesy intended in the late need
ed changes of the article of the con
stitution.
""Thus, Mr. President, if, in the
continuing of -our honored name
and that of your cabinet in our ad
ministration of the Red Cross, I
have committed an error so grave
as to merit a reprimand and be re
quired to make an open denial be
fore the world of privileges, I have
assumed, the powers I have usurp
ed, the disrespect shown the honor
ed heads of the nation and my un
avoidable and deep humiliation
thereat, I shall prove my good citi
zenship by exact and willing con
formity with and obedience to the
commands by the publication of
your honored letter and such re
plies as I have been able to make,
jn order that no misunderstanding
of your relations can possibly oc
cur."" The letter concludes thus:""
""Trusting that these concessions,
faithfully submitted, .may prove a
sufficient notice and guarantee to
the public of the disconnection
which you desire from the organi
zation which I have so long had
the pain to conduct, I have the
honor to subscribe myself.

  A cheering
crowd of 11.159 fans who attended
the 33rd annual Tournament of
Champions Golden Gloves copeti

Wednesday night may well have
watched a future world champion.
He is 18-year-old Cassius Clay,
a boxing cutie from Louisville,
who won top honors during the
tournament by defeating Jimmy
Jones of Chicago for the heavy
weight crown. Jones was the de
fending champ.
Clay, who was also the 1959
light heavyweight champion, mov
ed up into the heavier division with
ease with a masterful exhibition of
boxing skill.
In their bout, televised nation
wide along with three others on
the card. Clay jabbed, shifted out
of range, countered and generally
outboxed Jones, whose knockout
punch was held a big threat for
his opponent.
Boxed I.ike Veteran
In fact. Clay boxed so well that
there were those at ringside who
thought he could start out right
now as a winning pro. He fought
so much like a veteran Incident
ally. Cassius younger brother was
eliminated earlier in the tourna
ment in a bid for the light heavy
weight crown.
Sharing championship honors
with Clay was another talented
tan fighter, Jefferson Davis of
Nashville. Dans, an all-out clouter.
defeated Bill Joiner of Cincinnati
in an action-packed three rounder,
that was also televised.
In winning his bout on decision.
Clay used a stabbing left jab and
follow-up right to beat Jones.
Davis lashed out with savage
rights and lefts to halt his man
after Joiner had given him sev
eral unpleasant moments in the
first round.
Clay and Davis were the only
two champions among the eight
crowned Wednesday night. But
they left no doubt that they were just about the best of the number.

I battle of Olympic champions.
“Let Clay come to Italy,” said
the 26-year-old DePiccoli. “Frank
ly, I dont think he'll last three
rounds.”
The husky Italiain won the
Olympic heavyweight crown while
Clay took the light heavyweight
title in the 1960 games in Rome.
Since the Olympics Clay has
won all 8 of his pro fights and
is the No. 2 ranking heavyweight
contender. DePiccoli, a left-hand
er, is undefeated in 21 fights. He
is ranked 10th.
Rino Tommasi, the Italians
manager, said he made the offer
to Clay through Dewey Fragetta,
the internatinal boxing agent in
New York.
“I dont consider Clay a top
fighter,” said DePiccoli. “I saw
him at the Olympics and I wasnt
the least impressed. He may be a
better boxer than I am but I am
stronger.
“Of course I can make mis
takes. But I dont think Signor
Clay is unbeatable.”

CLAY is a handsome youngster

When the referee raised Cassius
Clays arm. in victory at the end
of his fight with Doug Jones, the

with peanuts, programs, cups and

The winning pitcher was E.

thats all that counts.
Not surprisingly, Clays bitter
est critics were the same ones
who had been most lavish in their
praise for him. They felt that
Clay had conned them played
them for chumps.
In away, they are correct. But,
on the other hand, they got just
what they deserved. After all,
they were the ones who pro
claimed Cassius Clay as some kind
of a superman after he had
knocked out a few mediocre fight
ers. More reserved writers took
a “wait and see” attitude about
Clay.
What his enemies seem to over
look is the fact that boxing is a
business. Something that young
Cassius Clay keeps in mind at all
times.
Everyone is always eomplain
ing about the sad state of box
ing. The turnout even for cham
pionship bout is low. People
just seem to have lost interest
in boxing.
Cassius Clay, by himself, 're
vived that interest. People turned
out to see him fight. Everyone
wanted to get a look at the loud-
mouth. Most of them wanted to
see him get a beating. But Clay
didnt care about that. As long as
they showed up, he drew the
money.

At Listons Victory Party
LAS VEGAS, Ncv. UFI — “This,”

Clay, the noisy, unbeaten con

remark after putting in an un

night, following the champions
one-round knockout of Floyd
Patterson.
Clay said he showed up at the
victory celebration “just to make
him Liston mad.”
He shouldered his way through
the crowd to where Liston was
sitting with some friends and told
the massive champion: “Youre
just a sucker. My brother could
nave beaten Floyd Patterson.”
Liston, in a rare burst of humor,
invited:
“Come over here and sit on my
knee and finish your oragne juice.”
Some further words were ex
changed and at one point Liston
rose to his feet and assumed a
mock fighting pose. Friends moved
between them.
Clay stole much of the thunder
from the fight even before it start

Clay stepped into the ring while
the announcer was introducing
famous boxers who were at ring
side. The fistic poet waved to
the crowd and shook hands with
Patterson.
Then he started for Liston with
his hand out — but suddenly re
treated in mock fear and bolted
from the ring.

          were broken last week. The mile record
          was lowered from 35.63 to 35.3B. The new
          quarter-mile record Is 8.16. and for the
          half-mile. 16.83 seconds. The kilometer
          now stands at 21.40, as against 21.46
          made by Oldfield. Burman Is now enti
          tled to the honor of ""speed king."" which
          honor came to him a few weeks ago at
          Daytona Beach. Fla.

          A word or two about the new record
          holders at this time would not be out of
          place. in view of the wonderful feats
          which they have performed behind the
          throttle.
          Robert Burman, acknowledged ""speed
          king."" is but twenty-seven years old.
          Bom near Imlay City. iMich., In 1S84, Bur
          man lived on the farm until about ??v
          enteen years of age. Then he went to
          testing automobiles, and tested the first
          car ever made by the Buick Motor Com
          pany, when the factory was located at
          Jackson. Mich. iAter he entered the em
          ploy of the Jackson Automobile Company,
          and soon became head tester. While he
          was thus employed a freak racing car
          was built in Jackson, and the builder In
          vited Burman to a five-mile match race
          on the mile horse track at the fair
          grounds. Burman took the chance of be
          ing shown up. and won the race by al
          most a mile.
          This started the speed career of the pres
          ent monarch of them all After much per
          suasion and the ofTer to pay hit own ex
          penses if the company would let htm have
          a car he was allowed to enter a tifty-mile
          race at Detroit in 1106. All of the big
          bovs of the game were in, but Bob start
          ed out to ""beat it."" and won the race
          hands down. His next experience was to
          drive twenty-two and a half hours of a
          twenty-four-hour race In St. Louis the
          same year and win by eiKhty-two miles.
          Then the Buick company got him and
          his career which gained him the name of
          ""Wild Bob"" started. He was but twenty
          three years old, but he proved hi? ability
          and his nerve, and hip promotion was
          fast. A list of Burman's winnings would
          fill a fair-sized volume. His most notable
          victory of 1910 was first American car
          in the Savannah grand prize race and
          third in the race. He won several long
          races at the Indianapolis motor speed
          way in July, 1010, but the disqualification
          of the Marquette-Buick cars loscredits he gained by clever driving.
          Burman left the Buick team early this
          year to drive the cars formerly owned by
          Barney Oldfield. He immediately drove
          the Ji*-horsepower Blitzen Benz faster
          than Oldfield ever had dared, thereby
          breaking all records for the kilometer,
          mile and two-mile distances. The rec
          ords made by Burman in the Benz at
          Daytona April 1011, were: Kilometer,
          15.88: mile. 25.40. and two miles, ftl.28.
          This is faster than man ever traveled be
          fore.

          Ray Harroun was born at Spartans
          burg. Pa., and is twenty-nine years old.
          He has driven in practically all of the
          great automobile races during the last
          three or four years. He holds a long list
          of records and has won many trophies.
          Harroun won more firsts than any other
          driver during 1010. Following are some of
          his records, regardless of class: 35 miles.
          42:03.35; 60 miles, 45:51.72: 65 miles,

          starts from this city Jun? and nidh at

          It will be one of the most picturesque

          Perhaps a number of manufacturers
          and o* tiers in the industry do rot fully
          realize what tiie Canadian reciprocity
          agreement means. It is of far greater
          importance t' the automobile industry
          than t'le avertge man imagines. The
          reduction of duty on American-made
          cars from 3.""? to :;o per cent opens up a
          wider channel for American goods to
          flow across the border, and brings a rich
          market for cars closer to our door.
          According to turer, Canada, within the next few years,
          will be buying loads of cars of the
          utility type for use in its vast grain re
          gion. When one stops to think that in
          the United States more than 80,000
          farmers use automobiles, and that hair'
          of these are grain producers, who find
          noicr tars economical in their business,
          it is not difficult to foresee that Canada,
          with its enormous- grain industry, the
          vastne^s of wpich scarcely can le con
          ceived. shorti.* will follow suit and adopt
          the motor car en a much greater scale.","May 30, 1911 : The Indianapolis Speedway hosts its first annual 500-mile race on Memorial weekend. Ray Harroun takes the prize."

          in aU'omobile speed competitions,
          and driving the speed creation or
          the most brilliant engineering minds
          of Europe and America, the drivers
          entered in the second annual' 500

          speedway will begin their long jour
          ey around the brick oval at 10
          o'clock next Thursday morning.
          For the second time In the history
          ot the world's greatest race course
          the five-century contest for cars un
          dep 600 cubic Inches will be offered
          to the speed lovers and the sporting
          Inclined followers of the automobile
          game In the United States.
          This is the greatest of. track 'races.
          The first 500 mile event on Ithe vitri
          fied oval at Indianapolis astonished
          the world, and Ray Harroun In nis
          Marmon Wasp was the hero of the
          nearly seven-hour speed combat. The
          first race taught the speedway man
          agement, the engineers, the drivers
          and last but not least, the public.
          The second race will astonish the
          world. The greatest drivers on this
          side of the Atlantic are entered and
          many of them participated In the
          first event. The cars are faster than
          In 1911. The requirements of the en
          try conditions were much more strin--genlt
          The facilities for handling the
          largest number of people that will
          witness a sporting event in 1912 are
          much improved over the 1911 condi
          tions and Indianapolis people by co
          operating with the speedway man
          agement and the hotels will be able
          to easily handle all Its guests.
          The motor speedway, at a cost of
          $650,000, has substituted a tunnel for
          the old foot bridge just north of the
          pits. This will facilitate the hand
          ling of the autos that are parked In
          the infield and the vast crowds that
          will view the race from this enclos-
          lirp. Thfl Ifnnnpl lu Inaf r.t-K rt f ia

          sage of two motor cars at tbefaame
          time, going in opposite diraftions,
          and also provides two passages for
          pedestrians elevated above the ve
          hicle passages.
          The pits at the south end where
          Harry Knight pushed his Westcott
          into the wall to escape crushing the
          Case mechanician, Anderson, last
          year, have been fitted with concrete
          walls like the other' pits in place of
          the former wooden partitions.
          The speedway has in every way
          perfected its arrangements to make
          safe every possible angle of the, race.
          The track has been gone over care
          fully and smoothed 'out. The driv
          ers were instructed Monday night
          at 8 o'clock, in a meeting at J:he Clay
          pool hotel by the A. A. A. officials in
          charge of the race, and cautioned to
          be vigilant at ""all times. An elaborate
          signal system for use in emergencies
          on the track has been worked out.

          Only the cars that comply with the
          entry requirements iu every particu
          lar will be allowed to face the sturt
          er Memorial day morning. Monday
          morning, May 27, at 9 o'clock, under
          the direction of Referee A. It. I'ar-
          dington, feta.it: er Fred J. Wagner and
          Chief Timer C. H. Earner and his
          assistants, ,the 27 eny.rans, began
          their trials to qualify. This de
          mands the lapping cf he track in 2
          minutes flat or at a speed of
          miles an hour for two and one-half
          miles.
          This afternoon at 1:30 o'clock the
          cars began to weigh in. This re
          quirement is 2,000 ""pounds or over.
          All steering knuckles, front axles
          frame hangers and steering mechan
          ism, including tie rods, will be sub
          ject to the approval of Howard Cot
          fin, famous as engineer and builder
          ot the Hudson car and the mechani
          cal engineer of the speedway. These
          details prove to the layman that the
          first race demonstrated to the speed
          way and the motor car designers and
          builders the necessity of the precau
          tions in running, a race of such a dis
          tance. Not only will the race for 500 miles
          be the longest track,, event in 1912,
          but it will also offer the largest
          amount of cash to the drivers of the
          modern spaceaters. Fifty thousand
          dollars is offered to these men who
          will catapult their cars through space
          for more, than six hours in an effort
          to cross the Jape first with 200 laps
          to their credit.

          De Palma. who lost the $10,000 puree
          when victory seemed certain, but the j
          fact that an American built car came j
          in the victor and set a new world's j
          record overshadowed the misfortune of i
          De Palma and his Mercedes and aroused I

          the truly patriotic enthusiasm that
          goes with Amerlpan success.
          Interest in the race was at a hlfb
          pitch throughout the six hours it was
          being run, and the bulletins that drifted
          from the race course telling of the
          shifting of places among the fast mov
          ing cars were devoured with keen
          eagerness. Most of the principal cars
          in the big race are represented here
          and the headquarters for the respect
          ive machines were the centers for
          emwds of zealots who gathered to learn
          of the progress of the race.
          That a new world's record was set
          was not a surprise, for it was gen
          erally conceded that the entries this
          year were the faatest cars that were
          ever matched. The victory of tRe Na
          tional car was also no particular sur
          prise, for the car was frequently men
          tioned as one of the most probable
          winners, judging from the fast time the
          entries were making in the tryouts.
          At the headquarters of the Howard

          eral Manager Tt. K. Roberts of the
          company was most joyous over the suc
          cess of the car because of the fact that
          he had freely predicted a National vic
          tory, and Dawson's car was .the very
          one in which he made several circuits
          of the speedway track during his recent
          visit in Indianapolis. On this'oocasion
          he was the guest of Herr, Dawson's re

          laurels.
          ""Setting the world's record at an
          average of 78.7 miles per hour with a
          regulation stock car means something,""
          eaid Roberts yesterday, ""especially as
          the car maintained that speed for six
          consecutive hours. It not pnly shows
          the strength and power of the motor,
          but the remarkable construction of the
          car, which at no time was forced to
          stop at the pit for mechanical adjust
          ments of any sort.""

          cess of the Mercer car which finished
          third, covering the 500 miles in 6:34.56,
          an average of 78.07 miles an hour. The
          Mercer has never failed to come in the
          money in any event in which it ever
          started."" said iilarx yesterday, ""but

          a splendid showing in a competition I

          Racing is but part of the manufacturing
          process that tests and perfects National cars for
          your safety, comfort and indefatigable service.
          A race such as the 500-milc event, won by the
          National from a field of cars from all nations,
          most of which arc higher priccd than the Na
          tional, is a much harder test of every ounce of
          power and every fiber of strength than a tour of
          thousands of miles.
          That the National again proved its superi
          ority is your unimpeachable guide to the best car.
          regardless of cost. The race demonstrates the
          reliability, power and longevity of the National.

          for 1913. With left-hand drive and center e r

          making the trip in his S. G. V. car, and
          expects to return over the road about
          September 15.

          A 1912 flvp-passenger Paige taurine car
          was delivered last week to G. O. Wilson.
          The car is finished in dark blue, with gray
          running gear, and Is"" fully equipped.

          To build, for the especial use of an
          automobile tour, a stretch of road over
          seventy miles in length, traversing a
          country that has heretofore been acces
          sible only to pack animals, is the unique
          feat of a body of public-spirited residents
          of northern Arizona.
          The new road connects the railroad of
          Ash Fork with the government reserva
          tion at Grand Canyon. The tour for
          which it was constructed Is the first of
          Its kind, including, as it does, an aggre
          gation of over sixty Studebaker cars,
          nearly all of which are owned in Phoenix,
          the Arizona metrppolis.
          When the tour was first announced it
          was the intent of the Phoenix men to
          drive their cars to the canyon by a rough
          roundabout route, following the lines of
          the Santa Fe railroad by way of Wil
          liams. Hut the citizens of Ash Fork ob
          jected. They readily appreciated the fact
          that their own town was missing a fine
          chance to show itself to advantage on
          the map. A committee accordingly told
          the Phoenix people that they would guar
          antee a more direct route via Ash Fork.
          Then they went to work with their picks
          and shovels, working out half-way, where
          they met a similarly public-spirited pang
          of road builders from Grand Canyon, who
          had laid out the second half of the trail.
          The whole Job was under the direction of
          the veteran ""BH1"" Bass, who has lived
          in the Grand Canyon country since be
          fore the days of the railroad, and lie
          has been locally credited on many occa
          sions with having dug the himself. This feat Mr. Bass modestly
          denies.
          The Studebaker Flanders ""20."" path
          finder tor the tour, recently made the
          trip to the canyon over the new road.
          Though the car carried tive men and
          their baggage, the run was easily made
          at an average speed of nearly twenty
          miles an hour.
          The entire distance over the new
          road longed slightly more than seven
          ty-three miles. About half was typical
          desert country, inhabited by prairie
          dog-s. coyotes, a few antelope and an
          immense herd of wild horses. The
          other half is similarly arid, but rather
          mountainous. For more than twenty
          five miles the road follows a tortuous
          valley. There is no human habita
          tion between Ash Fork and Grand
          Canyon, and not a single well or stream
          of water, except in the rainy season,
          now several months past.","May 28, 1912 : Joe Dawson wins in Indianapolis with the added benefit of increased prize money. There were no deaths at the race this year, a rare occurrence in motor sports at this time."

          amid the cheers of thousands and
          the waving of flags of five nations.
          The cars got away with a flying start
          and were going 50 miles an hour as
          they came down the. long home
          stretch.
          Jenkins' Schact was the first car to
          stop at the pits. The machine blew
          a right rear tire. He lost a lap by
          the stop.
          Before Jenkins started again, An
          derson's Stutz drew up at the pits
          with the same trouble.
          Ralph De Palma, in a Mercer,
          dropped out of the race on the eigh
          teenth lap, on account of cylinder
          trouble. He was soon followed by
          Jenkins' Schacht, which broke a crank
          case in the twentieth lap.
          Kerr's Stutz broke a clutch re
          lease in the back stretch and caught
          fire. He was out of the race. No
          one was injured.
          The boiling hot sun caused consid
          erable tire trouble and one car after
          another dropped in at the pits for a
          change.

          humiliation of seeing itself completely
          outgeneraled, thousands of lives and a
          loss of confidence in its prowess most
          depressing to its leaders. And it cost

          tation. But in the disaster there were many
          instances of conspicuous bravery, brav
          ery so inspiring that men talked of
          them during he long months of war
          that followed, and men in emergencies
          were strengthened to the same forti
          tude because they knew of what had
          been. Perhaps the day produced na
          more brilliant incident of high cour

          Spencer Wlshart, who drove a Mer
          cer car into second place at the finish
          of the race, was given a kissless and
          champagneles8 reception at the Mer
          cer pits, but his two hands, worn out
          by the steady work at the wheel of
          his car, were shaken wildly by a hun
          dred admirers. He was lifted upon
          the shoulders of his pit men and
          cheered with the enthusiasm equal to
          that accorded to the Frenchman. He
          was given a check for ?10,000.
          One of the most remarkable bits of
          race car driving was staged by
          Charles Merz In his Stutz car when
          he drove three and one-half miles,
          more than one lap around the course,
          with his car ablaze beneath the en

          hardly able to keep their seats on ac
          count of the flames that were licking
          at their legs. Merz was watched on
          his lap by the breathless thousands
          who feared his car would explode or
          that he would be driven from tho
          wheel by the ilameB. Displaying al
          most unbelievable nerve, he waved

          Spectators remaining in the grand
          stands and bleachers were on their
          feet straining for a glimpse of tho
          intrepid young Indianapolis driver as
          rounded the last curve and started
          down tho final Etrotch with tongues
          of flames spurting from under tho
          hood of his car. He could not havo
          mado another lap. His car would
          have gone to pieces in another mile.
          But it remained intact and continued
          to do his bidding until It limped
          across tho finish lino and Merz was
          $5,000 wealthier. Pit men had ex
          tinguishers ready and extinguished
          tho fire that soon would havo de

          W'HAT becomes of all the old
          automobiles?
          This is a question that has
          often been asked but seldom answered.
          Each year thousands of automobiles
          are manufactured and sold and thou
          sands are discarded to the scrapheap.
          Like all pieces of expensive machinery,
          the automobile winds up its career of
          usefulness by being sold for old Junk.
          Tho engines are often sold to second
          hand dealers, who utilize them for
          many different purposes.
          Many of tbe automobiles purchased
          years ago by El Pasoans-have long
          since found themselves in the discard,
          while others have burned, up. Perhaps
          the oldest car In point of service now
          owned In El Paso is a Rambler, pur
          chased in 1904 by Charles Rader. This
          car has traveled more than 100.000
          miles and Is today being used by Mr.
          Rader. The car is now nearly 15 years
          old and has seen hard service over the

          In Bad Weather
          Everybody knows the Hupmobile has long been
          the car of the American family.
          Now it is the winter car of the American
          family, because the Sedan top gives the family com
          plete protection, says the Lone Star Motor Co., the
          local Hupmobile dealer.
          I'd like you to see the car with the top fitted, be
          cause I'm pretty sure you will want one for your own
          family.
          The extra cost is so small that it is out of all
          proportion to the comfort afforded and the colds and
          doctor bills it prevents. N
          Its appearance is handsome it harmonizes per
          fectly with the 1915 Hup's beautiful lines it is sub
          stantially built and firmly, though temporarily,
          attached.
          Inside it compares with the richest limousine.
          And when spring comes, take it off and store
          it away.
          If you care for your family's comfort and your
          own, better see the new car.

          probably traveled further than any lit

          Kl Paso's First Anto.
          The first automobile ever brought to
          El Paso was owned by the late Frank
          Bell, who brought it here in 1901. He
          purchased the car from the Locomobile
          factory and it was a great curiosity to
          the residents of El Paso. Every time
          Mr. Bell appeared on the streets with
          the machine a large crowd would
          gather to inspect the new form of lo
          comotion. The automobile was only in
          Its infancy when Mr. Bell purchased the
          car and he did not find it much of a
          pleasure conveyance. As a rule the ma
          chine was seldom taken from the
          garage without balking a short dis
          tance down the street The machine
          burned up in a fire about a year after
          Mr. Bell purchased it.
          The First Electric.
          The first electric automobile ever
          brought to El Paso was purchased by
          Felix Martinez. He states that he pur
          chased the car about 1899 to be used as
          a delivery car for the Daily News, since
          absorbed by The El Paso Herald. But,
          like the Locomobile owned by Mr. Bell,
          the electric was anything but a success
          as an automobile. Mr. Martinez, in
          speaking of the car recently, laughing,
          said that the machine only moved Tlen
          someone had his shoulder against it
          and seldom moied on its own locomo
          tion. After several experiments with
          the machine, he abandoned it, and
          finally gave it to some boys who soon
          destroyed it The electric cost Mr.
          Martinez $2700
          Roads Too Rough.
          J. A. Smith purchased one of the first
          gasoline automobiles in the city. It
          was a failure, principally because of
          the rough roads and streets at that
          time, and he finally sold it to a Mexi
          can and the car has long since been in
          the scrap heap.
          The car was a Cadillac and the ton
          noau opened in the back, the passen
          gers stepping up as in an omnibus. The
          seats were on either side and in the
          back corners
          There were many other automobiles
          purchased from that time until 1907,
          but there were few of the cars that
          were successes. In 1907 the state
          paBsed the automobile license law and
          all motorists In the county owning ma
          chines had to havo them registered.
          This is the first record obtainable of El
          Paso automobiles.
          The first automobile license Issued
          in 1907 by Park Pitman, county clerk,
          was taken out by Dr. Frank Thatcher.
          He secured the license on August 1, for
          a Holsman automobile, a small runa
          bout He still 1ms the car and drives
          it each day The machine has seen
          seven years of continual service.

          took out the third automobile .license.
          This was his second car, however. His
          first one he purchased In 1902, when he
          gave up his position at the throttle of
          a locomotive and put the first public
          car into service in El Paso. Mr. Davis
          has been driving a public machine since
          that time. His first car was a Cadillac;
          his second an Oldsmoblle.
          The fourth automobile license Issued
          by the county clerk was taken out by
          W. B Latta for a Reo touring car. Mr.
          Latta states that he sold the machine
          a lear later, but docs not remember to
          whom.

          being available on both sides of the
          Atlantic Italy alone is expected to
          furnish no less than six machines.
          Changes in the specifications for the
          Indianapolis contest are numerous, the
          chief of these being the reduction of
          motor dimensions bv one-third, or from
          450 to 300 cubic inches, and the raising
          of the speed minimum to 80 miles.
          With much smaller machines better
          results are demanded. This Is the
          chief utilitarian function of the racing
          game.
          The number of starters has been
          raised to 23, as compared with 30 of
          ears previous. This Is the full ca
          pacity alloted the track under the rul
          ings of the American Automobile as
          sociation, which specify a limit of one
          car to everj 400 feet of track.
          Speed trials to determine the final
          field will be held 10 days ahead of
          the race, In the inverse order of en
          try, the fastest 33 being eligible. In
          the event of more than three cars of
          one ""make entering, the fastest three
          will be admitted. This Is to eliminate
          the speedway from wrangles between
          factories and private owners desiring
          to enter cars of the same make In ex
          cess of the A. A. maximum.
          Cars will line up for the start In the
          order of the time made in the speed
          trials, the fastest car starting in first
          position, next the pole. Racing num
          bers will be issued on the same plan,
          the fastest car receiving No. 1. This
          is to avoid the possibility of a spill
          during the flying start, when a slow
          machine in front would be in the why.
          The color of cars will be according
          to international usage, i. e, Germany,
          white; Belgium, yellow; France, blue;
          Italy, red, and America, red and white.
          In previous years Individual combina
          tions have been employed, at times to
          the great amusement of the spectators.
          Regulations as to the physical con
          dition of drivers and the mechanical
          soundness of cars will be more rigid
          ly enforced next year than ever be
          fore The front axles of all machines
          must thus be entirely new two days
          before the race This is to guard
          against possibility of accident, due to
          crystallization or other defect Any
          car spilling an excess of oil on the
          track, will, for like reasons, be dis
          qualified. The Dawson-Gilhooley accident of
          last year has caused chain-driven cars
          to be barred from the track, Unless
          the chains are adequately though not
          necessarily fully enclosed. Gllhooley,
          it will be remembered, came to grief
          because a bursted tire caught between
          his chain and gears, rendering his car
          beyond control, due to the action of

          RACERS WILL AGAIN DEFY DEATH MONDAY
          Once an auto racer, always in
          auto racer. There is something
          In that game of whizz and thrill
          that causes meu to forget; to
          Ignore all past injuries; and to
          risk, their lives again and again.
          When the big squad of the
          fastest drivers ln the world gets
          the word to go Monday at Indian
          apolis at least 20 men who have
          escaped death narrowly, who
          have been broken and torn, who
          have been hurled through the Ur,
          who have fried under burning,
          overturned wreckage of great
          racing machines, will shoot away
          from the mark.
          In the van will be Joe Dawson
          who, a year ago on that same
          track was hurled through the
          barriers, burned under the wreck
          age of his burning car and
          dragged out cut and torn beyond
          recognition.
          They are strange beings, these
          fellows who risk limb and m-yi
          for money and sport.
          Ralph De Palma, now premier
          driver of the world, has been
          known at once as the luckiest
          and unluckiest driver. His worst
          accident wan the crash at Mil
          waukee in 1912, when near the
          finish he had a mixup with Caleb
          Bragg that spoiled one of the
          greatest finishes of auto racing.
          Bragg is a man worth perhaps
          $5,000,000 who races for the
          thrills. He is ln this race.
          Even recent accidents seem to
          have little effect. Tom Alley
          went through a fence; Ed O'Don
          nell crashed into the fence and
          was turned over; Ed Pullen, who
          was badly hurt a year ago, mixed
          In another accident ln the Van
          derbilt this year aud escaped with
          slight injuries—and all are back
          to risk more of the same as smil
          ing and fearless as If nothing
          ever went wrong.
          John De Palatna has had a
          dozen bad spills, even though
          this is his first really big race.
          He is a brother qL the faniojs
          Ralph and the majority of his ac
          cidents have happened on the
          small ""bush"" tracks.
          Dario Resta, the wild man, had
          a terrible accident at Brook fields.
          was in a had smashup at Berlin
          and a worse one at Rome, but
          drives as if he never knew a car
          could turn ovtrr.
          Bob f_iir.ii.-iti has faced death
          many times. Perhaps his narrow
          est escape was in 1912 when ""its
          car blew out both roar tires at
          the same instant. The machine
          was hurled into the air, turned
          three somersaults, and alighted a
          smoking mass of twisted steel—•
          with Burnian underneath and .ie
          crawled out without dangerous
          Injuries.
          Yes, they are all back. So lo.igl

          Johnson dismissed the matter with a flno of $100 nnd a suspension of ono week.
          This does not seem enough, nnd It Is certain that a player of less lmportanro
          would have been treated rather harshly. Ruth is one of tho stars of tho lcaguo .
          and a prolonged nbsenco would havo ruined Boston's pennant chances. Also tho
          gate receipts would have suffered. So Bnttllns Ban beenme as meek ns a lamb
          and decided to ""give the boy another chance.""
          The bad feature of this case Is that It will cnconrago others to pull tho same
          Btuff. A week's layoff nnd $100 fine Is nice, gentle punishment, nnd tho chances

          ""Stuffy"" Busted In .
          EARL HAMILTON, the left-hander who won six consecutive
          pames for the Pittsburgh Pirates this spring, and then en?
          listed in the United States Navy, used to Bay of ""Stuffy""
          Mclnnis, then first baseman of the Philadelphia Athletics:
          ""If a left-hander should place a baseball in a burglar-proof box
          and try to sneak it across the plate in the middle of the night he'd
          find 'Stuffy* Mclnnis there waiting to hit. There's one bird who lives
          in luxury off left-handers. He can hit anything they pitch.""
          We observe that ""Stuffy"" broke it up yesterday.
          Vaughn passed Shean, Whiteman blew himself to a single and
          then Mclnnis. catching one of ""Hippo"" Vaughn's southpaw shoots,
          firmly laced it to left field for the single that scored Shean and gave
          the Red Sox the first game.
          It appears that this Beries is going to run to form.
          Victory Was Merited
          'fHE Cubs should have won, you say, but shoul dthey? In the first,
          1 third, and sixth innings they had men In scoring positions. A single
          would have scored two runs and beat the Sox in two of these innings;
          in the other the score would have been tied. But Pick, Paskert and
          Deal couldn't deliver the essential wallop when the time came. Base?
          ball is, more than anything else, a matter of doing the right thing at
          the right time. Mclnnis did that Pick, Paskert and Deal didn't.
          Ruth in the supreme test surpassed Vaughn, even though the pitching
          figures would indicate that Vaughn had the better of an exceedingly
          interesting duel. The assertion that Chicago should have won merits
          specific qualification.
          Ruth Is Boston's Ace
          THE Red Sox, always a ""money team,"" are legitimately jubilant.
          At worst they will come back to Boston with one victory and two
          defeats. More of such excellent pitching and they will do better.
          Should they win two games and lose but one in Chicago they will be
          the long enders in whatever betting is done after the third game.
          But the jig isn't up with Chicago. Far from it. Vaughn meas?
          ured up to expectations and proved that the Sox do not relish first
          class southpaw pitching. Mitchell has Tyler in reserve and he can
          shoot Vaughn back in the third game if necessary. It remains to be
          seen if Bush or Mays, right-handers, can do as well against the. Cubs
          as Ruth did. Ruth is a great personality on a ball field. A giant in
          stature, resolute of purpose and with a wonderful ""single-track""
          brain, re represents almost the ideal athlete for competitive effort
          under groat -Tain. Bush and Mays are not Ruth's equals in tem?
          perament. ,
          Fielding Rather a Surprise I
          THE fielding was a surprise. There were no errors, but neither
          were there hard chances. Chicago hit the ball into the air in the
          pinches and it is a bit early for any one to pull a Snodgrass. The
          Cubs' steck might have soared had the ball been hit on the ground
          and at one of Boston's ""green"" infielders. Likewise the Cubs ac?
          quitted themselves with honor in the field, but few of their plays,
          too, were made under strain.
          It is an old superstition that the team which wins the first game
          takes the series in this play. But it doesn't follow that there can't
          be exceptions to what has iUogically come to be regarded as a rule.
          The Sox met the rest best yesterday, but more of the Vaughn type
          of pitching and the Curs cannot fail to come through.

          BY
          LOUIS A. DOUGHER
          Georsre Herman Ruth, better known as Battering Babe Ruth, prin
          ipai slugger in major league baseball these day?, has recently given
          ha world an insight into his peculiar brain procesa?if you will admit
          e possesses a brain. Incidentally, hie speech shows him to be quite in
          ccord with many others who think little of their plighted faith. Though
          ;? has two more years to complet? his contract ?with the Boston Red
          ex at a salary of $10,000 yearly. Ruth would sign a new one calling
          ?7T $20,000 yearly. Furthermore, he says he will not play with the Boe
          ra club unless his wishes are granted.
          . Last spring Ruth held out until the last minute. He wanted a
          alary of $15,000, if our memory be correct, but finally compromised by
          ?ft?ing a three-year-contract calling for a salary of $10,000 yearly. All
          oat took place before he began hammering home runs until he had
          Token ail previous big league records for this stunt. He admitted that
          e was satisfied with the treatment given him by both Harry Frazee and
          Jd Barrow. He proved it by playing fine ball all season. But Babe has
          '?gtened to -erpent tongues. Now he would quit playing ball unless the
          ?oston club agrees to make a new contract calling for $20,000 a year.
          The Joke of the sltuatioa is that
          tarry Frasee la In pretty much of a
          "" ? He has established a precedent
          W Ruth to follow by trading Carl
          is;, s to the New Tork club when the
          ubmarine funger grew tired of
          iking along with a losing club. So
          ar as Frasee ia concerned, he has
          ittlc argument to offer Ruth when
          'Bey ?ret together for a conference
          ?garehng this contract matter But
          ni? doesn't absolve Ruth, just the

          This must be great reading for
          those misguided fools in Boston who
          presented Battering Babe with a $500
          diamoci at the close of the season
          a? an appreciation of his great work
          for the city. Some day the fans will

          of the Red Sox, who told of the sale of Ruth, declined to name the
          price paid, but declared it was larger than had ever before been paid.
          The deal was said to have involved no other players.
          Estimates, unofficial, but said to have been based upon ""inside
          information,"" placed the figure at which ""Babe"" Ruth was told at
          ,the unprecedented sum of $125,000. Efforts to have this estimate
          substantiated or denied failed, but it was generally reported that the
          figure was not far from correct.
          Highest Figure Yet Paid.
          If the estimate proves accurate, the sale of Ruth not only ele
          vates the trading of baseball players to inclusion in the category of
          sugar, shoes, clothing and other high-priced necessities, but records
          a sale at more than double the highest price heretofore paid for
          a player.
          When Alexander and Killifer were traded from Philadelphia to
          Chicago, $55,000 changed hands. The greatest price paid for a single
          player up to the trading of Ruth was said to have been the $50,000
          given for Tris Speaker when he went from the Red Sox to Cleveland.

          AST Mason ""I' .abe"" Ruth broke all
          baseball records by hitting twenty*
          nine homo runs. Ar.l this season
          there is every indication that ho will beat
          his 11*10 total by a wide margin.
          What is tho se ret of Ruth's ability to
          make home runs with such surprising fre
          quency? ?; it because he Is possessed of greater strength than his fellow players?
          Is it because his vision is keener or his museles better ca-ordinated? All these tilings
          doubtless have some thing to lo with it, but the real reason for thl:- iii.yionn'nal
          series of home runs sci i nee finds to be the way Xvitlx applies to his work with the bat
          certain well-known principles of physics and psychology. ""But."" you say. ""Iluth Is a ball
          plavor. What does ho know of physics or psy chology?"" Notheing, perhaps, but whether con
          sciou.ly or unconsciously Ruth applies certain well-known principles of these two sciences
          every time ho makes a homo run. Let us consider some of the many inter rsting scientific
          factors involved in bat t itig a ball. As very follower of baseball knows, a home run is
          the knocking of the ball out of the reaoli of opposing players and in .r.uch a direction
          and to nuch a distance as o make its return impossil'o before th? runner completes the
          circuit of the bases. Viewed as n mechanical proolem. the hit ting of a home run moans
          simply hitting t)i ball with the bat so as to give it great
          speed in the proper direction. The spe^l
          and direction which the bat can To made to
          give tilt; ball depend on the degree of tin
          curve which tlio pitcher has imparted to
          the ball, the weight of the ball, the. weight
          of the bat, the elasticity of the ball and
          bat. and the angle at which tin, ball iir
          pinges on the bat.
          The speed which a ball t * es on im
          mediately after its collision w'th the bat
          is a little difficult to compete because
          neither the bat nor the ball is perfectly
          elastic or perfectly non-elaaMc. To illus
          trate tlio difficulty of such a o mputation
          let mo explain what happens when per
          fectly elastic and perfectly non-elastic
          bodies come into collision.
          If two inelastic bodies?say two pieces
          of lead?of equal weight and going with
          equal speed, but in opposite directions
          meet squarely ""in mid-air, they will both
          stop and fall to the ground, all theii
          energy of motion having been turned into
          heat. If, however, perfectly elastic bodler
          of the same weight going with the same
          velocity, but in opposite directions, mee?
          in mid-air, they will bounce back with
          the same velocity they had originally. 11
          one of these bodies has twice the velocity
          of the other, the latter will bounce back
          with twice its original velocity and tho
          former will bounce back only half as fast.
          All this applies to bodies having tho same
          weight. Whenever one of the colliding
          bodies is heavier than- the other, the ve
          locity given tho latter body upon bouncing
          is enormously increased.
          The bat which ""Rabe"" Ruth wields and
          the ball which he hits are both fairly clas
          tic; therefore, everything else being equal,
          the ball will be driven farther the heavier
          the bat and the faster the bat is moving
          as it hits the ball. Also, as tho weight of
          ""Halm"" Ruth' s body prevents his bat from
          doing much bouncing back, tho faster the
          ball corner, the farther It will go when ho
          hits it.
          The weight of tho ball Itself is a very
          important factor in hitting a homo run,
          viewed us a scientific problem. If thero

          were no atmosphere, everytliine be
          ing equal, the lighter tne Dall happened to
          ho the farther it would go. The friction of
          the air. however, slows the ball up con
          siderably, and this fact has to bo taken
          into consideration with several others.
          The conclusion which science reaches Is
          that the heavier tho ball is, without In
          creasing its size or decreasing Its elas
          ticity, tho farther it will go after being
          struck with tho bat.
          The direction taken by a batted ball is
          affected to some extent by the rotation of
          tho ball as it strikes the bat. Thi3 factor
          is of the neatest importance when the
          but does not strike tho ball squarely.
          It is possible for the hat to hit the ball
          in such a way that it actually increases the
          latter's rotation. In other words, it is per
          fectly possible for the batter to hit tho
          ball in such a way that it takes on a de
          cided curve. Everybody who plays golf
          knows what a common occurrence this is
          on the links. A golf hall when struck acci
          dentally oft' centre will ofton describe the
          weirdest imaginable path through the air,
          particularly if it passes through various
          air currents.
          A honr n depends to a very large ex
          tent up ? direction given the batted
          ball. T ' ortanco of this factor 'may
          he estimated a- nine times that of tho
          speed given the hat*~d ball. 13y direction
          we mean not only the horizontal angle, but
          also the vertical angle at which tho ball
          leaves the hat. For example, no matter
          how hard the ball is hit, it will never re
          sult in a home run unit's .""t clears the
          upstretched arms of the p1 ?yers in tho
          field.
          It is plain that the direction given
          the butted ball must depend to a largo
          extent upon the manner in which the ball
          is travelling before it meets tho bat. Pro
          vided the ball is given a proper rota
          tion on its horizontal axis by the pitcher,
          the kind of curve best suited to make it
          difficult to hit it at the proper vertical
          angle is either tho down shoot or the up
          shoot. On account of the many variablo
          factors concerned science believes that any
          home run made with either of theso curve3
          is a lucky chance pure and simple.
          After the ball has boon set in motion by
          the bat with a certain speed, tho distance
          it will go depends upon the vertical angle
          at which it starts. The most desirable
          angle i3 one of 12 degrees with the ground,
          or about half a right angle. Other factors
          which determine the distance a batted ball
          will travel are the speed of the ball, its
          sphericity, the smoothness of its surface
          and its lack of rotation. Tho greater tho
          speed of the ball tho more perfectly
          spherical it is. tho smoother its surface
          and the less rotation with which it travels
          the farther it will go. Atmospheric con
          ditions, of course, enter into tho problem.
          A ball will go farther in a clear air that is
          free from moisture. Tho wind may carry
          it bodily for quite a distance or may retard
          its progress.
          If science wore asked to make it difficult
          or well-nigh impossible for ""Babe"" Kutli to
          Ltit a home run it would select a day w.ien
          tho barometer was high, with the air so
          heavy with moisture that it would retard
          the progress of tho batted ball. Iho
          pitcher selected would be one good on very
          alow but curvy downshootfl. If such a
          pitcher were not available, one who hid
          euch great speed that lie couid put any
          kind of a ball over the plato for tho
          batter would bo chosen. With this
          hind of a pitcher the ball is likely to
          be hit behind the plate and unlikely to bo
          started on its course at the proper angle.
          His hitting of a homo run could then bo
          mado stHI more difficult by compelling the
          redoubtable ""Babe"" to use a bat either so
          heavy that he could not swing it with much
          speed, or so light that it would tend to hit
          tho ball at tho wrong horizontal angle.
          There is a certain spot on the bat, usu
          ally a few inches from tho end. but vary
          ing with dlfVerent bats, which science
          knows as the centre of percussion. If the
          ball hits the bat exactly on this spot tho
          greatest effect is produced. All ball play
          ers are aware when the ball hits this spot
          on the bat, not only through the absence
          of jar to the arm, but also through a pecul
          iar satisfaction which is hard to define,
          but which is no doubt physical as well as
          mentnl.
          ""Babe"" Ruth's phenomenal home run rec
          ord is largely due to tho fact that, con
          sciously or unconsciously, he has found a
          way of producing the collision between
          his bat and tho ball on this centre of per
          cussion more frequently than any other
          player.
          What is called the centre of percussion
          is a principle that enters into the design
          not only ot baseball bats, but of all things
          designed for men to swing. In the ham
          mer, for example, the centre of percussion
          should be in the head. If the tool is not
          designed so that this centre is properly
          located the hammer is unsatisfactory to
          use because it jars and tires tho am too
          much.
          The problem of hitting homo runs with
          the surprising frequency that ""Babe"" Ruth
          does is ono more complicated in the mat
          ter of powers of Judgment and observa
          tion involved than in mechanical prin
          ciples. Viewed as a mechanical problem,
          tho home run requires a bat just as heavy
          as a player can use with comfort, tho bat
          to bo given a motion as fast as possible
          when hitting the ball, and striking the
          ball so that it wilt ho impelled into tho
          air at an anglo of approximately 42 de
          grees or half a right angle. The ball
          should also, of course, be hit at such a
          horizontal angle as not to cause a foul.
          T^lio weight of the batter has very little
          to do with tho matter of home runs, hut his
          arm muscles are a controlling factor to
          the extent of, say, fifty per cent. Of course,
          If his arms are rigid enough to make tho
          bat for all practical purposes a part of his
          body when he hits the ball, and if his body
          is swung forward at just that instant, it
          Is possible that a heavy batter, all other
          things being equal, would be able to knock
          the ball farther than a lighter player.

          To follow tho ball as it leaves the pitcher's
          hand is no easy matter, as tho sphere is
          often travelling at the rate of lf0 feet
          a second, or nearly two milos a minuto.
          The eye movement necessary to follow it
          increases greatly as tho ball draws nearor
          and nearer the plato, owing to tho in
          crease in the angle of vision which, by the
          time the ball is over tho plate, is about
          ten times what it was when it left tho
          pitcher's hand.
          As 1 have said, tho pitcher often hurls
          the ball at the rato of 150 feet a second.
          But tho ball is travelling much faster
          than that when it leaves ""Babe"" Ruth's bat
          after being hit for one of tho home runs
          that have made him famous. This is in
          accordance with the laws of tho impact of

          Of courso, If it Is raining
          when one of ""Babe"" Ruth's
          long hits is made, the
          drops of water striking tho
          ball will bring it to the
          ground long before it
          otherwise would fall. Tho
          rain also makes the ball
          heavier, and as It contains
          only so much energy to
          k start with, it will bo

          on.., wo find, by applying a well known
          formula of physics, that 1,200 foot pounds
          of actual energy or work is done. Now,
          if it takes Ruth one-twentieth of a second
          to impart this energy by a swing of his bat,
          this would be at tho rate of 24,000 foot
          pounds a second, which is about forty-four
          horsepower.

          the hitting of tho long scries of home runs
          which ""Babe"" Ruth has been making for
          two seasons. The batter must bo able to
          ""sense"" in some manner not yet fully un

          of ball when it passes over the plate. Tho
          player's Judgment about tho bull must bo
          made within tho smallest fraction of a sec
          ond after it leaves tho pitchpr's hand.
          Through some queer sixth sense?tne
          kinaesthotic sense, as psychologists call it
          ?all batters have tho feeling as to whether
          the trnll tho pitcher is about to throw is go
          ing to pass over the plato or not. In tho
          average batter the impressions conveyed
          by this sixth sense caunot be more than 50
          per cent accurate, but in the case of ""Babe""
          Ruth, as his batting record shows, they
          must be about 90 per cent accurate. As
          everybody who plays baseball or ever
          watches a game knows, you can't strike out
          and make a homo run. and the player can
          seldom hit a home run unless the bail ha
          strikes is taking a course that would havo
          carried it straight across the plate unless
          Interrupted by his bat.
          This, then, is the secret of ""Babe""
          Ruth's home runs as viewed from a scien
          tist: standpoint. A highly developed kin
          aesthetic sense enables him to ""sense"" the
          kind of ball the pitcher is going to throw.
          When a ball rotating on Its horizontal
          n.\is and curving most favorably for his
          purpose comes along he swings his bat at
          it with an energy sufficient to chango its
          direction and greatly increase its velocity.
          The bat Is swung in such a way that the
          centre of percussion meets the ball, send
          ing it upward at an angle of 42 degrees
          and not too far to the right or the left.
          When all these things happen the result
          should bo a home run, provided that the
          pitcher has given the ball proper speed
          and that tho wind and other atmospheric
          conditions aro favorable.","July 1920 :	Physicist A.L. Hodges alleges that Ruth has a ""44 Horse-Power Swing"""

          Great American Question 4
          By W? O. McGeehan
          IF THE lata lamented Shakes?
          peare were a' baseball writer he
          might usa a line that he
          wested upon some more or less
          obscure hero of antiquity and say of
          ""Babe"" Ruth, ""He doth bestride the
          narrow baseball fields like a Colos?
          sus."" For ""Babe"" Ruth is Hercules
          and Thor reincarnated, the Colossus
          of Swat. His bat is the club of
          Hercules and the hammer of Thor,
          the symbol of sheer, primitive might
          before which the puny folk bow and
          offer worship.
          But for the game of baseball, the
          youngest game of the youngest peo?
          ple, George Herman Ruth, the
          ""Babe"" Ruth who dwarfs all other
          personalities in the daily news,
          might have been a peaceful cigar
          maker or perhaps a third-rate
          heavyweight pugilist instead of the
          national idol of the American people.
          The ""Babe"" was Fortune's dar?
          ling, though Fortune concealed her
          great and kindly intentions as far as
          he was concerned when the ""Babe""
          was 2. boy. For the ""Babe"" was
          born left-hander!. Hercules was a
          right-hander. Thor never was pic?
          tured as wielding his hammer from
          the port side. None of the heroes of
          antiquity, as far as can be ascer?
          tained, was a southpaw. Harry Leon
          Wilson was the first novelist to put a
          left-hander in the near-hero class,
          and he i ;d it in a half-hearted
          fashion.
          Moreover, little George Herman
          Ruth was a half-orphan at a very
          early age and was sent to an insti?
          tution for orphans. He was nearly
          an orphan boy, and, according to
          the San ford and Merton books, he
          should have taken a morbid sort of
          point of view at an early age and
          learned something useful. But the
          youth of ""Babe"" Ruth was applied
          mostly to the study of the great
          American game of baseball.
          You are not going to draw any
          conventional moral from the early
          boyhood of ""Babe"" Ruth. He was
          not a particularly industrious or
          thrifty lad, chockful of conventional
          virtues. He was just a normal,
          chuckle-headed combination of Tom
          Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn. He
          Was Just natural and just human.
          FORTUNATELY the boyhood of
          ""Babe"" Ruth was intrusted to
          men who understand human
          nature, and particularly the human
          boy?the Christian Brothers, of Bal?
          timore. The fraternity is not limited
          to Baltimore. It is all over the
          *orld. It is made up of big-hearted
          ?fcn. consecrated to the work of mak
          lfig men out of the raw material.
          They had charge of the bringing
          UP of George Herman Ruth and
          'hey have turned over to the world
          ??Colossus of Swat. It is due to
          th*ir human understanding that
          George Herman Ruth was not
          wwarted and turned aside into more
          Wo**ic iine8 0f encjeavor,
          U?Kt lanatiQ than ?sqr *rf fbe
          I boy romances of Tattered Tom and
          Ragged Dick, by Horatio Alger jr.
          ; is the rise of ""Babe"" Ruth. The Al-,
          | ger heroes became mere bankers or
          traction magnates, but George Her
          | man Ruth, the waif of Baltimore, be?
          came ""Babe"" Ruth, at whose shrine
          ' bankers and traction magnates burn
          incense. Ever and anon these jaded
          near-successes pick up the tape, not
          to see the condition of the market,
          but to learn whether the latest is the
          forty-fifth or forty-sixth home run
          ! knocked out by the ""Babe"" for the
          I season.
          And these heroes envy ""Babe""
          ! Ruth the left-handed, the boy who
          ! was regarded as far from bright in
          ;his classes. For the ""Babe"" can hit
          them out with the joyous freedom of
          Hei-culcs swinging his club or Thor
          throwing his hammer through the'
          clouds. All the tricks of the pitchers
          are vain when he faces them, and all
          the walls of the baseball parks are
          lowered when his bat crashes against
          the baseball. Homer would have
          loved him if the blind singer had had
          a season pass to the Polo Grounds.
          THAT Ruth is the greatest bat?
          ter of them all is admitted by
          two members of the old Orioles;
          and when two members of the old
          Orioles agree upon anything, that
          makes it official and irrefutable. If
          there is anybody so ignorant of im?
          portant American history that he
          does not know who the old Orioles
          are, we will explain, more in pity
          than in indignation, that the old
          Orioles were members of the great?
          est baseball team of a generation or
          so ago.
          The two Orioles who made the ad?
          mission that ""Babe"" Ruth was the
          greatest baseball player in the whole
          world are Wilbert Robinson, mana?
          ger of the Brooklyn National League
          baseball team, and Joseph Kelly,
          scout for the Yankees. Both of these
          gentlemen are grandfathers and citi?
          zens of high repute in the city where
          they dwell, which also happens to i
          be the home of ""Babe"" Ruth. ""Wil-1
          bert Robinson was a catcher, and still
          ; holds the world's record for consecu?
          tive base hits in one game. Joseph
          Kelly was an outfielder of sorts on
          the old Orioles, and his present oc-1
          cupation is ""ivory hunting,"" looking
          upon baseball playera and appraising
          them ?at their true  jrtb to their
          employers and to the national pas?
          time.
          These two authorities admitted"" to
          me in th? presence of witnesses that
          never, even in the days of the old
          Orioles, was there a baseball player
          who could hit like ""Babe"" Ruth. Con?
          sider the importance of this admis?
          sion. The members of the old Ori?
          oles are the most conservative per?
          sons in th vorld. Never before
          have they au. : ..ed that any player
          of the present was anywhere near as
          wonderful as tl\e players of their
          glorious day.
          ""He can hit them harder than any?
          body, and he can hit them oftener,""
          they admitted from the fullness of
          their hearts. They did not qualify
          the statement, They did ?ob assert
          that the pitchers were less canny
          and that the ball parks were smaller.
          They admitted that the heroes of
          their day were lost in the shadow of
          the Colossus of Swat. They admitted
          that even in the days when the old
          Orioles were young ""Babe"" Ruth
          would have loomed up above them
          all.
          That Ruth broke all big league
          records for home run getting last
          year is in the book. That he has
          broken his own record this year and
          is on the way to setting a mark far
          beyond the misty horizons ?if the
          baseball world is l?o\vn. But the
          old Orioles have explained away the
          performances of other more modern
          heroes of baseball. Ruth's achieve?
          ments they Jrott ungrudgingly.,
          That is almost as marvelous as the
          achievements themselves.
          .
          ONCE upon a time the youth of
          this land worshiped another
          young giant, a right-hander
          and an exponent of another and el?
          der sport?John L. Sullivan. The
          right arm of John L. ?Sullivan was
          mighty in its day, but the left arm i
          of ""Babe"" Ruth is mightier in its I
          day and generation in the matter of
          sheer numbers of worshipers.
          | They used to block the corridors
          of the hotels, and even the streets,1
          ? to see the mighty John L. pass. They
          do that in the case of ""Babe"" Ruth,
          I too. It is not for me to disparage
          | the memory of John L. Sullivan, the
          | gladiator, in th? days-cf hi? greatest
          -?
          ring glory, but I think, that his ad?
          mirers saw that particular John L.
          through rose glasses and that they
          worshiped an illusion.
          The John L. Sullivan of the later !
          day, the John L. who beat down his ?
          own worst enemy and lifted up his ;
          self-respect from the muck, was the
          John L. that should have been wor- ;
          shiped, for that John L. Sullivan :
          was a mighty gladiator. The John ,
          L. Sullivan who knocked out ring an- j
          tagonists with a right-hand punch to j
          the jaw was a mere mass of brawn ?
          and muscle, but the gray and fat old |
          John L. who conquered himself was i
          the true fighter.
          But we are considering the John L.
          that was the popular idol, the '
          brawny man who was followed by '
          the men and the boys and cheered
          when he stalked abroad. He was !
          not a particularly affable character.
          This big ""Babe"" Ruth is a far
          more likable person. He is full of i
          good nature and the joy of living.
          He is a modest enough young man, :
          and he knows his limitations, though ;
          he acknowledges no limitations as j
          far as the baseball diamonds and j
          the fences around them are con
          cerned. He is not falsely modest to
          the point of affectation, for he has
          that supreme confidence in himself
          that comes after certain achievement.
          But he will not play to the gallery
          consciously. He likes the gallery
          and he understands it, and he likes
          to have it understand him. ?
          Ruth is, perhaps, too simple, or
          it may be too wise, to try to fool his
          gallery, as other stars of his own ;
          game or stars in other lines of en?
          deavor have tried to do in vain. For
          nobody can fool his gallery. No
          truly wise man ever tried.
          THE best judges of a man ar?
          the men with whom he works !
          or with whom he plays.
          ""Babe"" Ruth, naturally, is the high?
          est salaried ballplayer on the New
          York Yankees. He might, if he were
          like some of the stars of baseball or i
          stars of some of the arts, claim all
          the privileges of a star and hold
          himself aloof from his fellow players.
          Here again is the simplicity or the
          wisdom of ""Babe"" Ruth. He plays
          the game with the team and for the
          team, and the men ' he plays with
          know it and appreciate it. ""Babe'
          Ruth will even make the ""college
          try"" to get a base on an impossible
          chance. The ""cdllege try"" is the vet?
          eran professional's term of contempt
          for zealous endeavor that seems fu?
          tile on the facts of it.
          _ an the ""Babe"" *nake?th? two
          owners of the Yankees, Colonels I
          Ruppert and Huston, shudder with !
          apprehension when he hurls himself
          against a wall to get a fly ball, or I
          when he throws his huge bulk
          through the air in the effort to steal i
          a base. They rejoice in his spirit
          and his wholehearted way of play?
          ing, but at the same time they per?
          spire with apprehension lest some?
          thing should happen that would de?
          prive them of the most expensive in?
          vestment in professional baseball.
          Some stars have disrupted base?
          ball teams, rousing jealousies, but
          ""Babe"" Ruth, admittedly the great?
          est star of them all, has made the
          Yankees a team. The advent of the
          ""Babe"" has brought them the chance
          of that ""world's scries dough,"" which
          should be something like $7,000 a
          player. It has also made them the
          team of the big leagues. They do not
          begrudge the ""Babe"" the homage
          that is paid him. As far as Ruth
          is concerned, there is no professional
          jealousy on the Yankee team.
          Just to what extent the present
          prosperity of professional baseball
          is due to ""Babe"" Ruth I would not
          care to say, but it is considerable
          When I first trailed West with tht
          Yankees, they told me in Chicagc
          that there had been little or no in
          tereat in the Chicago White Sox. Bu
          I when the Yankees came ta Cbicagi
          they turned out to the extent of 20,
          000 a day and upward to see the
          ""Babe"" ""bust one.""
          Once, with the score 2 to 1 in the
          eighth and a tense pitchers' duelen,
          the Chicago pitcher passed ""Babe""
          Ruth. Ten thousand people started
          to walk out of Comiskey Park.
          There remained yet the chance of
          the melodramatic ninth inning rally,
          but the ten thousand had lost all
          interest in the game for the after?
          noon. It was clear thatr they were
          not going to see ""Babe"" Ruth knock
          a home run, and nothing else mat?
          tered.
          Civic pride, inter-city rivalry, in?
          terest in the national game were
          minor considerations. The ""Babe""
          was not due to ""bust one.""
          IN CLEVELAND 1 was talking
          to two tired business men early
          in the afternoon.
          Said one of them gravely:
          ""This 'Babe' Ruth is a menace. He
          is responsible to a large degree for
          i the lack of production in these
          : manufacturing towns around the

          day and you will see thousands of
          young men taking the afternoon off
          just to see 'Babe' Ruth 'bust one.'

          Harold Muddy Ruel, the energetic pepper box who does Washing
          ton's backstopping day in and day out in a manner which has won
          him praise all over the American League circuit, is practically a
          unanimous choice of this section of the United States of America
          for honorable mention on Babe Ruths all-American baseball com
          bination which will be instrumental in sending two readers of this
          newspaper to the world series month after next.
          In pawing through his enormous correspondence containing selec
          tions to be matched against Babes from readers of The Washing
          ton Times sporting pages, “Skillet” Finn, Esq., is strongly reminded
          of the esteem in which Ruel is held and it may be gratifying to the
          thousands of contestants for the two free world trips to know that
          their fellows are boosting Ruel for Ruths consideration.
          In “Skillet” Finn, Esq.s humble opinion, there is no better con
          clusion to draw from a thorough study of the big league catchers
          than that Muddy is a perfect all-around catcher. Whether his royal
          majesty, Babe Ruth is of the same belief remains to be seen. Its
          a Chinese cinch that the Bambino will have to look far and wide for
          a better candidate than our own little backstop, who has the admira
          tion of thousands of American League followers.

          teenth street, in inditing an all-

          with Babe Ruths, and in hopes
          that his choice will earn him a
          jaunt to the series with ""Skillet""
          Finn, Esq., as guide and chaperon,
          says that Muddy Ruel is the
          “greatest catcher in the business.”
          Thats a pretty broad statement,
          but not overdrawn in the least, for
          it is a treat to see a catcher lik®
          Ruel back there working his head
          off every minute of the game-
          Warren Smith Hammond, 2523
          Thirteenth street, is a bit mild in
          his praise of Ruel, but names him
          with Ring and Pennock as his
          battery. He says, “Ruel is a VERY
          GOOD catcher and is no mean hand
          with the willow.” But Warren is
          only a little boy thirteen years old
          and his expression is certainly
          forceful for his years.
          Then comes the stamp of ap-
          Rroval slapped on Ruel by J. F.
          Iclnteer, of Quantico, Va. who
          earned one of the free trips to
          New York last year. With but
          a slight difference in person
          nel, Mclnteers choice of a year
          ago was almost identical to*
          Ruths, and his opinion about
          the players this season ought to
          amount to something.
          ""Ruel is the best and steadiest
          catcher Ive seen this year.” writes
          Mclnteer and “Skillet” will say,
          that Mclnteer has seen plenty be
          cause the Quantico telegrapher has
          been sneaking up to Washington
          all summer long taking stock of
          the Griffmen as well as the invad
          ing teams. The remainder of his
          team outside of Ruel is: Jamieson,
          Cobb, Wluat, Kelly, Hornsby,
          Sewell, Dugan. Johnson and Vance.

          ARRIVES FOR SPRING TRAINING
          «George Sisïer, Star First Baseman of the St. Louis Browns,
          Arrived in Bogalusa Tuesday—Interesting Story and
          Record of Diamond Star Taken from Baseball Maga
          zine of New' York.
          The greatest baseball player in the j
          world, George Sisler, arrived in Bo-j
          galusa Tuesday and on Wednesday j
          was at practice, enthusiastic over the
          grounds an dconvenienccs arranged j
          here for the Browns. With such ideal
          training conditions, Mr. Sisler be
          lieves that his record of last year will
          not compare with the one he intends
          to make this season. Readers of The
          Enterprise wil] be interest in the fol
          lowing story of Sisler and his won
          derful playing.
          George Sisler was the most bril
          liant player of 1920. His dazzling
          ■exploits dominate the records as those
          of Ty Cobb used to. In batting he
          was easily first with the phenomenal
          average of .407. In run scoring he
          tied for first place with Tris Speaker
          at 137 tallies. In stolen bases he was j
          second only to Sam Rice, the flyiftgj
          mercury of the Washington Senators. I
          In number of runs driven in, he tied j
          at second place with his teammate j
          -Jacobson at 122 tallies, acknowledg-j
          mg no superior but Babe Ruth. Nor j
          was his wonderful batting record in
          -any sense a fluke, for Sisler took part
          in the full schedule of 154 games and
          appeared at bat more than any other
          player, 631 times. In the number of
          his hits, he not only exceeded all com
          petitors, but broke the previous
          American League record with a grand
          total of 257 safe hits. What is more,
          he led all competitors in number of
          total bases, even Babe Ruth with his
          54 home runs being forced to take
          a back seat. Just one short of an
          «yen 400, Sisler piled up a grand to
          tal of 399 bases, a record unmatched
          in modern baseball. In two-base hits
          he was second only to Speaker. In
          ""three-base hits he was second only
          to Joe Jackson. In home runs he was
          second only to Babe Ruth. Such a
          record is an all-round masterpiece
          whose like may not be seen again for
          many years.
          From his youth up a veritable gale
          of good fortune has blown George
          Sisler on his way. While he was still
          a school boy in an obscure Ohio town,
          prominent baseball men had their eye
          on him. While he was a college un
          der-graduate big league clubs were
          eager to sign him. His entry into
          major league baseball nearly precip
          itated a war of the magnates and
          was remotely responsible for the
          overthrow of the National Commis
          sion. His career with the St. Louis
          Browns has been a continuous tri
          umph, always on the upward scale,
          culminating in the grand climax of
          the season just closed. Favored by
          «verj possible talent, fleet of foot as
          an arrow, a wonderful fielder, a phe
          nomenal hitter, and when so minded,
          a brilliant pitcher, Sisler is one of the
          greatest all-round players, if not tlje
          very greatest, that baseball has ever
          produced.
          This is high, praise and yet the
          faces deserve it. In purely offensive
          departments of play, Sisler has not
          yet equalled Ty Cobb, though during
          the past season he fell little short of
          the Georgian at his best. In defense,
          however, Sisler is a better natural
          fielder than Cobb. He is furthermore

          trip to the first block of world senes games as a guest of The
          Washington Tinies.
          Lundy probably feels that he is certain to be among the five who
          will make the coveted trip as winners in the Babe Ruth All-America
          selection contest.
          The Babe Ruth editor was slightly amazed when he received from
          Lundy exactly 40 different combinations, at least one of which Lundy
          hopes will be identical with the selections to be made by Babe Ruth.
          After reviewing thia well Informed 4
          fan'* lineups the Babe Ruth editor
          was forced to the conclusion that
          Lundy had earned, by actual toll,
          the trip he is bent upon taking as
          a prize.
          For each ot his 40 line-ups is ac
          companied by a carefully and con
          vincingly worded explanation ot why
          he chose each player.
          Lundy has set a record for Babe
          Ruth contests. His line-ups are the
          most numerous ever submitted at
          one time.

        Three French chemists M. and
        Mine, Curie and M. Bemont have dis
        covered a new metallic element, which
        they call ""radium,"" because of its re
        markable property of emitting rays
        which resemble in their penetrative
        power Prof. Roentgen's celebrated X
        rays. Not long ago much surprise was
        caused by the discovery that uranium
        is capable of emitting similar rays, but
        the power of radium in this respect is
        Eaid to be 900 times greater than that
        of uranium.

        TI-jE CATHODE RAY OUTDONE.
        WHEN the marvels of the cathode or X ray
        were made known to the world only a few
        years ago, it was believed we had reached a
        degree of photographic power that would not be sur
        passed for generations to come, and that for the use
        of surgeons in locating foreign substances imbedded
        in flesh or bone it would be of permanent value. Yet
        according to reports of experiments made by Pro
        fessor Barker in Philadelphia a short time ago, that
        wonderful ray is about to become a back number be
        cause of the potency shown by a newly discovered
        element known as ""radium.""
        The discovery of the new element is due to M. and
        lime. Curie and is the result of investigations stimu
        lated by the discovery of the X-ray. They were ex
        perimenting in 1898 with uranium and its salts, which
        exert a feeble photographic power, when they ob
        served phenomena indicating the existence of an un
        known factor in the mass. They at once directed
        their investigations to the separation of that element
        from the substances with which it was associated
        and found not one but two new elements. To the first
        they gave the name ""polonium"" and to the second
        '•radium."" The first is believed to have a radiant
        power five hundredfold greater than that of uranium,
        but Professor Barker estimates the efficiency of ra
        dium at one hundred thousand times that of uranium.
        For this reason and because of its comparative cheap
        ness and simplicity the second of the Curies' discov
        eries seems destined, it is said, to replace the costly
        and complicated X-ray apparatus in the realm of sur
        gery.
        The most extraordinary characteristic of the new
        element is thus described in an account of Professor
        Barker's experiments by the New York Tribune:
        ""The practicability of deriving one form of energy
        heat, light, electricity or chemical action— from
        some other has long been recognized, but it is axiom
        atic that none of them can be produced except by that
        method. It is believed that the most man can do is
        to transform. It is thought that he cannot, in any
        true sense, create. Roentgen obtained his X-rays
        only by a conversion of force previously existing in
        the form of electricity. But a radiance which will
        penetrate opaque bodies and act upon the chemicals
        on a photographic plate is secured from radium with
        out the apparent use of any known species of energy.
        The phenomenon may yet be explained. But at pres
        ent it looks very much like what has long been re
        garded an impossibility, the spontaneous generation
        of force.""
        The discovery of unknown elements of such mar
        velous potencies at this late stage in the investigations
        of science is a striking proof of how little we know
        of the substances that lie around us or of the forces
        that act upon them. There is no telling wlrit wide
        and high uses may yet be made of radium, but it is
        probable the discovery will be one of the most im
        portant gifts which this century v:ill bestow for the
        guidance of science in that which is to come

        more than when she lived in Paris
        as young girl, washing bottles in
        a laboratory that she might con
        tinue her scientific studies on an
        Incom, of twenty dollars a month
        And a diet of black bread and milk.
        The $100,000 Madame Curie
        Fund will be used to purchase one
        grain of radium for the woman
        that discovered radium. And that
        radium will be used by Madame
        Curie in her scientific |studies
        the studies that have given such
        magnificent results to the world
        Of science and have never given
        one sany of profit to Madame
        Curie.
        At sixteen Marie Sklodowski,
        now Marie Curie, was graduated
        from the -Girls' Gymnasium, re
        esiving a medal of gold. She was
        then a well-educated scientist.
        Next she worked in the physics
        Iaboratory of the Industrial Mu
        mum. in Warsaw.
        On her father's death rhe went
        to Paris to continue her scientific
        studies. On an income of $20 a
        aonth she lived alone in one small
        room, her furniture an iron bed
        and one chair, her diet black bread
        and milk.
        She found work in a scientific
        laborator as a washer of bottles
        and contmiued her studies. Pro
        fessor Lip n, observing her
        ability, ealed her to obtain a
        free course in physics, chemistry,
        and mathnenatics at the Sorbonne,
        *where she now lectures and teaches,
        the first woman tq be thus hon
        ered.
        You have heard ""proud man""

        It would do such men good to fol
        low Madame Curie's work as it led
        up to her discovery of radium, a
        discovery shared by her husband,
        Prof. Pierre Curie, but due chiefly
        to her.
        Everybody knew that salts of
        thorium and various substances
        emnitted rays possessing the qual
        Ity of radiation, discovered by Pro
        fessor Becquerel. Madame Curie
        and her husband learned that
        pitch-blend. also produces radio
        active force that will pass through
        any substance, lead and steel ex
        S That vague information satisfied
        others, but Madame Curie was de
        termined to know just WHAT it
        was that caused the radioactivity.
        For three years she worked stead
        Ily, intensely, using in experiments
        every penny above the actual cost
        Sof keeping herself alive. In her
        work she ""reduced"" tons of pitch
        blende.
        At last, in 1900, in Paris, a
        watchcase was exhibited contain
        ing a speck of the world's rarest,
        most extraordinary element. It
        was labeled ""Radium-Discovered
        by Madame Curie.""
        .In 1911 Madame Curie obtained
        the Nobel Prise for chemistry.
        When her husband was killed in
        1906 there was no one able to take
        his place at the Sorbonne, except
        his wife, and that ancient institu
        tion broke its rule of centuries and
        Invited a woman to the full pro

        AN IMMORTAL WOMAN
        The visit of Madam Marie Curie to this country in May
        will be celebrated by American women with the presentation
        of a thimbleful of radium to the distinguished scientist. At was
        a beautiful tribute to the modesty of womankind that Mine.
        Curie made when she discovered the element which has revo-
        lutionized physics, chemistry and some branches of medicine,
        and gave it an impersonal name. The courtesy of the labora-
        -tory dictates that the discoverer of a new thing under the sun
        may give it his own name if he wishes, and so perpetuate nia
        own glory. Mme. Curie called it radium, because it gives out
        HINTS TO GARDENERS
        More than sentiment attaches to the gift. Of course, it
        money value, something like $100,000, will have little weight
        with a devotee of science like Mme. Curie.: She will use the
        radium for scientific research. Although Mme. Curie knows
        more concerning radium and its potentialities than any living
        soul, she has not, because of her generosity, one grain with
        which to conduct experiments.
        The history of the discovery of radium is one of the most
        exalted romances that the world has ever known. The daugh-
        ter of a professor in the University of Warsaw, the present Mme.
        Curie was drawn to Paris by the magnetic pull of the renowned
        scientific schools there. In conjunction with the scientists
        Becquerel and Curie, she began a series of experiments with
        uranium which led to her discovery of radium. It also led to
        her happy marriage with Professor Curie. That the discovery
        was that of Mme. Curie alone was well established by a com-
        mission which awarded her the Nobel prize in 1903.
        The hope which radium holds out to the world is that it
        may be the means of fighting cancer, that malignant disease
        which has baffled physicians for centuries. Undoubtedly there
        are new fields into which researchers can go. And it is in these
        unexplored regions that Mme. Curie will venture. The women
        of America honor themselves by providing the means.

        The annual distribution of the Nobel
        prizes which are given for distin
        guished work in several departments
        of scientific and allied studies took
        place recently at Stockholm. It is in
        teresting to note that the prize for the
        most important contribution to chem
        ical knowledge was awarded to Ma
        dame Marie Sklodowska Curie of the
        University of Paris, the well-known
        Catholic scientist and co-discoverer
        with her husband, Pierre Curie, of
        radium. This is not the first time that
        she has been thus honored. In 1903
        she shared with her husband half the
        Nobel prizes for physics, the other
        half being awarded to Professor Bec
        querel, the discoverer of radioactivity.
        Each of the five Nobel prizes which
        are awarded annually amounts to
        forty thousand dollars.
        Madame Curie is a native of Poland,
        where she was born in 1868. She
        studied chemistry in Paris with Pierre
        Curie, whom she afterwards married.
        Together they continued their chem
        ical researches in the School of
        Physics, their greatest discovery be
        ing that of radium in 1898.

        After the announcement ot this di0-
        covery honors and scientific recogni

        Pierre Curie was accidentally killed
        and his wife succeeded to his profes
        sorship. In 1908 she was appointed
        chief professor of physics in""the Uni

        At the Congress of Radioactivity

        jnonths ago a signal honor was con
        ferred upon her by designating as the
        ""curie"" the unit of measurement for
        radium emanations. Her name will
        thus be perpetuated in the annals of

          NEW YORK, N. V., June 15.— A fire
          started in tue biggest of the Government
          buildings at Ellis Island at 12:30 o'clock
          this (Tuesday) morning, and, spreading
          with frigbtinl rapidity, was at 1 o'clock
          sweeping over the whole island, and it
          seemed almost certain that every building
          would be destroyed.
          Telegraphic and telephonic communica
          tion was cut off, but the tire had lit the
          whole bay and every tug with fire ap
          paratus on board started for the island.
          By the time the police had started a great
          crowd had gathered at Battery Park. The
          flames were then shooting a Hundred tret
          in the air, and by their light hundreds of
          people could bo seen on the island rush
          ing hither and thither.
          There are usually more than 1000 per
          sons, most of them emierants, who sleep
          on the island. The customs officials
          thought the number there when the
          tire broke out less than 1000, most of
          whom arr ved on three ships yesterday.
          The officials thought tbe boats and men
          Bent to the island were enough to handle
          the immigrants who escaped from the
          burning buildings, no matter how scared
          they might be.
          At 1:15 o'clock a great crash was beard,
          and a moment later there was another
          tremendous shower of sparks flying into
          the air. When it had cleared a little it
          was seen that two walls of the main
          building had fallen in.
          For two minutes after this crash the
          crowds that had been seen on the island
          rushing around were lost sight of, but
          when the smoke cleared away it could be
          teen that a hundred or more tugs had
          reached the island and wore taking the
          people aboard. At this time every build
          ing and every shed seemed to be burning,
          and there was absolutely no shelter for
          the people anywhere. The beat was in
          tense. The whole island is|ooly six acres
          in area. The unfortunates were forced to
          crouch, fur on the cater edge until the
          ho: f'iv J.
          At 1:30 o'clock thf ferry-boat John G.
          Carlisle arrive 1 from the island with 200
          emigrants and all the sick patients from
          the hospital there. As the boat got to the
          pier a crowd made a rush for her. The
          i police charged on the great crowd and
          fought their way to the boat, the officer*
          ot the boat standing on tiie upper deck
          screaming. ""We've got sraa'lpux patients
          aboard Go back go bick
          The crowd retreated pre.uita:ely. The
          Carlisail the nurses employed on the ilund and
          by Mrs. Wtiite, wife of the resident phy
          sician. She said thnt when she boarded
          the boat she had not heart of any one
          being injured, and thought all the emi
          grants got out of the buildings safely.
          One of the oilu-ers of the boat said the
          fire originated in one of the lowers of the
          main building. At the time it started all
          the emigrants were asleep. The watch
          men sounded the alarms before they did
          unytuing towaid tiehting t: c fire, and in
          that way it :ot such a great headway that j
          by the time they could turn their atten- j
          tion to it it was sweeping through the ram
          shackle buildings utterly beyond con'.rol.
          Tfie tire was first -een In the northwest
          corner of the building, which is the de
          tention building, by Captain W. J. Burke,
          who is in charge of the night watch.
          Burke said all the rtoms in the building
          are connected by an elecric alarm, and
          that ;ii qu.ckly as possitle he rushed to
          the main ollice and rang the alarm in all
          the rooms.
          This alarm, he said, summoned the
          eleven men and two women under him.
          There were at the time 110 in
          the main building. Cv the time these
          people got out the whole building, from
          tower to tower and side to side, was a
          n.as.3 of swirling flame?, whi h shot hun
          dreds of feet in the a;r. Within a tew
          minutes after the fire started the miserable
          i water supply on the island was almost
          completely cv: off|v bthe bursting ol pipes
          which run along inside he main build
          i ing, so that when the first detachment of
          police arrived It was impossible to secure
          a stream of water with enough force to
          have any effeci.
          Just directly north of the main build
          ing stood the hospital in which were
          lifty-seven patients. Ihe admirable dis
          cipline of the nurses and medical staff
          i shov.-ed itself and the fifty-seven patients
          j were quickly wheeled or helped out of the
          building. One woman who was nursing a
          child suddenly lemembercd she had left
          her baby behind. She beat the air with
          her bauds and then tried to rush back
          into the flames. She was held back by
          tliree attendants. Presently the nurse
          came around with the baby in her arms.
          Every official a reporter saw on the
          i island said positively that no lives had
          i been lost. Ail the emigants were brought
          to the barge office lor tne night. Com
          missioner Seuner said he would person
          ally furnish a place for all sick emigrants,
          and the city hospitals would not be asked
          to take ttiem.
          Dr. Senner says the building* burned
          cost the Government $780,000. He does
          not know what accommodations can be
          arranged for the receiving of emigrants
          until they are rebuilt.

          THE FINE NEW IMMIGRANTSTATION ON
          ELLIS ISLAND—TO BE FINISHED
          BEFORE JANUARY
          The new Immigration Bureau on Ellis Island,
          which has been in course if erection since August, 1898, is nearing completion, and in its
          present condition makes an imposing appearance
          from the New-York shore. Although this is a
          United States building, it has not been erected
          under the direction of the Government Supervising Architect's office, but by the architects who
          received the award In a competition which was
          open to architects all over the United States.
          When completed, the new building will furnish
          roomy and pleasant quarters for the immigrants, where they may be examined, ""assorted.""
          forwarded or detained, and will In- a great improvement on the present cramped and inconvenient quarters at the Barge Office.
          The building is about 300 feet long and 100
          feet wide. The base is granite, and the building
          proper is brick, with limestone trimmings The
          flat roofs are covered with tile and the sloping
          roofs with copper. The structure is elevated
          about fifteen feet above the landing pier, and
          the distance from the place where the immigrants are landed to the main hall is about one
          hundred feet. This space is a glazed porch
          which will serve as a protection to immigrants,
          as well .is baggage, when they are transferred
          from the barges to the bui.ding. From this
          light and roomy vestibule the newcomers will
          go up a large stone stairway to the upper floor.
          where the Inspections will be made. This room
          is about one hundred by two hundred feet In
          size, and its arrangement, the divisions by wire
          screens, rails an-J partitions, were made after
          careful study of the experiences at the Barge
          Office during the last ten years.
          On the lower floor all the baggage will be
          taken care of. There will be a number of dormitories on the third floor, and the wings of the
          building will be occupied by offices.
          In addition to the main building there will be
          a hospital, a building containing baths and a
          restaurant, a kitchen and laundry building, a
          boiler house, physici ins"" house and ferry houses,
          and these will all be connected by covered and
          protected walks. The bull lings will all be uniform in style of architecture and material.
          The architects, Boring & Tilton, have provided
          f rroof gardens in the construi tion of the main
          building These are not positive features of the
          new building, but the roofs are so arranged that
          gardens may b built with little difficulty,
          The contractors are making good progress with
          the work, and hope to have it completed before
          next January. Th •
          cost  the structure will be
          about §I.I.MM NM». which is only about ""_ \u25a0

          examination* are conducted on the second floor and
          the baggage Is handled on the first floor. The big
          examination room Is two rtorles high. It Is the
          largect room in the building. On a level with the
          third floor a railed visitors' gallery runs around It.
          It Is fringed with the offices of the Immigration
          o9dala, rooms for the meetings of the Hoard of
          Special Inquiry, for records, for the Contract
          Labor Bureau and for more minute medical and
          contact labor examinations. The chief rooms on
          The tMrfl floor are dormitories for detained Immi
          grants.
          GOOD 6ANTTARY CONDITIONS.
          .Extrezas rare has been taken to have th* sanitary
          condiUcr.s as close to perfection as possible. The
          floors are of asphalt, with raised edges around the
          walls, so that they can be thoroughly cleansed with
          water. The walla for seven feet above the floors
          are of X£eene cement. Above this they are of
          white, hard surfaced plaster. There are no cor
          ners where a hose may not be turned. The white
          walls and the dark green trimmings are refreshing
          to their suggestions or cleanliness.
          Everything has been so arranged that the Im
          migrant passes through the station very much
          after the faanlon of a roll of paper through a web
          press. Upon landing at the pier he enters a pas
          sage which leads to the entrance of the examina
          tion building. Once Inside, the passage leads up a
          flight of broad stairs, which turn before reaching
          the second floor, and discharges Its contents onto
          the broad, open floor of the great vaulted examina
          tion room. Here the preliminary medical Inspec
          tion Is made. Th* immigrants Into whose physical
          condition there should be further examination are
          here weeded out and turned Into a room near by.
          The others go forward through numerous narrow
          aisles. These are the parting of the ways. As the
          Immigrants leave them they a;e separated accord
          tag to their destinations.
          THREE PASSAGES FOB EXIT.
          A stairway opens before the Immigrants as they
          leave the aisles. It Is divided into three passages
          by wire screens. Those for New-York now have
          free access to the covered passage to the New-
          York fern* Flip. Those who are to go away by rail
          are taken bark through the building past the ticket

          two divisions, that destined for New- York in one,
          ar.a that going out on the railroads in the other.
          The baggage for the railroads is properly checked,
          and the immigrants are then taken to a steam
          boat landing adjoining the one where they landed
          *n? «-re transported to the railroad stations.

          come, to the United States.
          That a treaty be negotiated with Mexico respect

          cannot hi- done, that the Mexican border be close.!
          to all except American citizens and bona fide resi

          Canadian government respecting the enforcement of
          the immigration laws of that country and the United

          That immigration stations be erected at Boston,

          Ellis Island
          Ends Operations
          NEW YORK, l^i—Ellis Island is
          closed after serving as the gateway to America for millions of immigrants during the past 62 years.
          The tiny island in New York harbor in recent years served chiefly
          as a place to keep deportees. Immigrant clearance abroad reduced
          the number detained on the island j
          to almost nothing.
          Last Friday the last of 50 persons
          still detained on the island were moved to the mainland and Edward J. Shaughnessy, district immigration director, said: ""Business
          is closed.”
          The immigration service will
          keep a skeleton crew on Ellis. If
          New York City or some federal
          agency does not take over within a year, the island will revert to
          the governments General Services
          Administration.

          der, is far from being a gateway that
          .would prepossess arrivals from Europe
          in favor of their adopted country.
          The island is tied around from dook
          to dook with miles of red tape. It is
          a fearfully tedious matter to land in
          America and a most unnecessary
          amount of fuss and feathers seems to
          accompany the entrance of a new ar
          rival into the land of freedom.
          A visit to Ellis Island, when the liv
          ing freight of two or tbree ocean
          steamers is being sifted through the
          various avenues leading to the boat
          that trasport8 ir to the Battery, pre
          sents so many phases that it is well
          worth braving the trip in an immi
          grant ferryboat from the Barge Office
          to see the sight. Around the big room

          from this a view of the whole interior
          can he obtained.
          The first stage through which the
          new arrivals pass iii the scrutiny of
          the medical oi?ser.s und the Ellis Isl
          and matrons. Having proven that
          they are free from physical defeuts
          the immigrants are o riven into fenced
          in passages leading io the registration
          officials.
          Through these fe aced avenues the
          unfortunate steerage passengers,
          wearing every variety of eccentric
          and un-American head-gear, and car
          rying as much portable baggage as
          they can stagger under, edge their
          way along foot by foot in the direc
          tion of the gate of hope through
          which alono they caa get to liberty.
          The procession slouches forward at
          the rate of about a foot in ten min
          utes, the delay being caused by the
          laborious attempts of the uniformed
          official tu extract the necessary infor
          mation regarding the incomer's birth
          and .parentage, etc
          Fortunately the official speaks an
          almost infinite variety of languages or
          tho task he has in hand would bc a
          well nigh hopeless one. AB it is, ow
          ing to the nervous condition of the
          immigrant, it usually takes an almost
          interminably long time to drag out
          an answer to the simplest question,
          j Everything has to bo repeated several
          times and explained in the minutest
          J detail and then occasionally the ques
          tioner has to give it up and turn the
          obtuse foreigner over to au assistant,
          j But somehow or other the line
          moves on. Each man and woman
          IMMIGRANTS AT TE
          hitches the family belongings along
          as the space betw?sn them and the
          man in the brass buttons decreases,
          and the hope that springs eternal in
          human breast buoys them up to be
          lieve that some time they will be able
          to pass the official who so jealously
          guards thc-entrance to the open space
          beyond. Ttn their hands the immi
          grants clutch the doouments handed
          to them on boar! ship, for all this
          questioning and registration at Ellis
          Island follows a preliminary cross-ex
          amination before the steerage passen
          gers are allowed to leave the ship.
          The immigrants are ticketed, too-a
          very necessary precaution, for there
          are several steamship line\ all landing
          passengers in a promiscuous mass, and
          without that ticket it would be a Her
          culean task to sep irate one lot from
          the other. So, ticketed and registered
          and served with documents and cross
          examined and pushed and jostled into
          place in the line, the hopeful refugee
          from monarchy-riciden Europe travels
          slowly into thu premised land.
          When the immigrant has passed suc
          cessfully through the ordeal of an
          swering the sharp catechism of the j
          official at tho top of the laue, he is
          handed to the mercies of tho crowd on
          the outside and thenceforth becomes
          common property at tho mercy of
          hotel and boardinghouse runners, rail
          road agentd, well meaaing but offi
          cious missionaries, restaurant keeper*,
          and if he ba lucky enough to have
          theni, relatives nu I friends
          He is u luckies* wight during this
          period of his transition tocitizeuhood.
          First of al, ho must change hit
          money. This can bo clone at the
          island, -where a firm of money brokers
          his purchased the solo right to money
          changing. The immigrants* savings
          are brought from all sorts of extraor
          dinary biding placee, sometimes from
          the depths of stockings, from the* in
          side of waists, where nothing short ol
          a knife or a pair of scissors CHU secure
          its release, from shoes and belts, and
          even from the mouth.
          To watch Money Changer Scully at
          work is one of the most interesting
          sights on the island. The rapidity
          with which he changes into current
          coin of the republio Russian roubles,
          Italian lire, German marks, French
          franc?, English sovereigns and Aus
          trian florins is marvelous. Only one
          glance seems necessary, and the band
          goes down into oue of tho well-filled
          cash drawers. Two or three eeconds
          later and the amount of exchange lies
          before the immigrant with a paper
          showing how much has been exchanged,
          and the bewildered foreigner is told
          to stand back to make room for the
          next applicant. He might as well
          take it for granted that the amount is
          correct (as, of course, it is) for, if he
          looked at it with that air of stunned
          stupidity for au hour, he would not
          know anything more about tho strange
          money than before. Occasionally one
          holder than the rest will make an at
          tempt to challenge the accuraoy oi
          the amount given him, upon which an
          attache of the money changer's office
          unios PEN.
          will take the coins from the immi
          grant's hand and explain the value ot
          each as he drops it baok again. It is
          wasted time, however, as the owner of
          the money is left in as bad condition
          of dense ignorance a*3 ever.
          Money will buy things on Ellis
          Island and the proprietors of tbe
          lunch counter?, where bologna and
          bread appear to be the staple articles
          of food, aro at liberty now to cuargo
          on the mob made hungry by the long
          wait in the lines. The scouts for
          these lunoh counters are indefatiga
          ble workers and certainly earn their
          money. The wonder is, from thc way
          in which the immigrants are almost
          dragged to the bologua counters, that
          some one does nob get hurt in the
          scrimmage. If the greenhorn gets
          through the experience all right and
          survives the bologna, lot him brace up
          to resist the onslaught of the railroad
          agents, who will bear him off bodily if
          he does not keep a sharp look out.
          In this neutral ground at Ellis
          Island the scene ou a busy day is be
          wildering and distracting. The offi
          cials do their be3t to keep the mixed
          mass of humanity in something liko
          order, but with so many nationalities,
          with excited men and women running
          around looking for their baggage and
          for each other, children crying and
          relatives and friends all chorusing a
          welcome together in various lan
          guages, it is no wonder that the scene
          looks like a pocket edition of pande
          monium.
          As fast as possible the immigrants
          are hnstled into the ferry boats and
          transported to the Battery, and grad
          [E LUNOH COUNTER.
          nally the island is deserted by all save
          tho tired offisials and tho detained im
          migrants.
          A sorry-looking orowd is this last.
          From the detention pen they watch
          the fortunate ones who .pass the bar
          rier with envious eyes, looking eager
          ly at every stranger who approaches
          them to see if there is not some hope
          coming from ?some where. In all the
          driven and badgered crowd that passes
          to the boats there is none which is not
          light-hearted, for tho red tape ordeal
          is over. The prisoners in the deten
          tion pen have nothing to buoy them
          up. After eoming all this way to reach
          this land of promise, they get only a
          glimpse and are sent baok to the wil
          derness again.
          One ol the queerest personages on
          the island is the barber. It is hardly
          correct to call his place a shop, for it
          is merely a corner of the big room
          where tho barber has placed a chair
          and hung up a mirror and a towel or
          two. Judging from the condition of
          tho majority of tue immigrants, the
          barber is au institution sadly needed
          at Ellis Island, but few seem to utilize
          his services, advertised at the prices
          of twenty cents for a hair cut and ten
          cents for a shave.
          The crematory at Ellis Idand is an
          other very necessary acsos?ory. Jt is
          not intended for the cremation ot hu
          man bodies, but merely to give the
          clothing of suspicions arrivals a thor
          ough chance to shake ott any disagree
          able associations with infectious dis
          ease or obnoxious insects.
          Fairly good arrangements appear to
          i have been made for the bonsivg cf
          i immigrants who are compelled to stay
          i on tho island over night, tue old pow

          der magazines having been converted I
          into comfortable sleeping rooms.
          One of tho worst Bourses of annoy
          anoe to the officials are the crowd of
          relations that flock to Ellis Island to
          meet incoming passengers. They are
          always in the most intense state of ox
          citement and it is all that the gate
          keepers can do to prevent them break
          ing down the barriers in the mad rash
          to get inside of the enclosnre.
          There being no police on the island
          it is necessary for the officials to take
          the law into their own hands and
          maintain order by force. It wonld
          be a decided improvement if some of
          the strongest and most reliable mea
          on the island were sworn in to act as
          special policemen.
          An old landmark of the island is
          gradually yielding to the infirmitses
          of age. This is the historical tree on
          which the pirates, Hicks, Wormsley
          and Gibbs, were hanged when the*
          place was known as Ellis Island. The
          tree was damaged during tue storms
          of last winter, and has recently been
          broken off short by the wind. All that
          is left of the tree now is about seven
          feet of bare trunk, and this the Eliis
          Island gardener is making every effort

HANDCUFFED MAN LEAPS INTO

Harry Houdini Gives Throng of Spec

Minutes of Suspense While
Submerged
Five thousand spectators held their
breath in sympathy with Harry Hou

noon when the handcuff marvel did a
Count of Monte Crlsto stunt by leaping
into the lake heavily manacled.
OOoo! I bet hes drowned, said a
small boy in awed and shuddery tones
when the man remained what seemed
an interminable time beneath the shim
mering water of the lake.
A small line of bubbles came to the
surface. Then larger bubbles arose
and a little cloud of mud drifted to tho
top. Five thousand shivers ran down
5000 spines.
Oh, why doesnt he come up? asked
a nervous old lady who had waited

worry about the fate of the misguided
youth.
Hes unlocking the shackles. Ho
will be up in a minute or two, said a
high school girl.
Oh, dear, a minute or two Is enough
for him to drown In, was the dismal
reply.
Aw, hes stalling, shouted an Irre
pressible urchin.
No hes not. He has to get them
shackles off first. He cant swim with
them on. This from a bright lad with
a wire bridle on his teeth who waited
two hours and went home with an
autograph which read: Harry Hand
cuff Houainl.
A man on the landing threw off his
coat and ran to the edge of the planks
looking intrntly into the water.
Hes going to jump, shouted the
throng.
Hes stuck In the mud. Someone
has got to rescue him, shouted a wise
guy who had seen Houdini Jump from
a bridge thirty feet high into 300 feet
of water or 300 feet high into thirty
feet of water. The crowd never got It
straight.
More bubbles. More mud. Then
Houdini canre slowly to the surface
feet first!
I told you hed stuck his head into
the mud. said the wise guy. Then the
feet disappeared. A second later Hou
dinis head bobbed to the surface. He
made it dramatic and shivery enough to
satisfy even the small gamin who had
half hoped to see a drowning or at least
aTthrllHuK rescue scene.
Laden with heavy chains and hand
cuffs enough to restrain the county
road gang Houdini leaped from the
roof of the pavilion at Westlake park.
His hands were shackled behind him.
TbTM biff uatrolmen attended to that
little detail. There are some members
of the force who would have liked to
have defeated the handcuff king even
beneath the water.
With no free hand to guide him in
the headlong dive the mans body shot
forward in an almost horizontal posi
tion. With an indescribable midair
kick he righted himself and made a
pretty but dangerously vertical dive.
The shutters of 800 cameras clicked In
unison and the awful suspense began.
The horror only ended when the mans
smiling face appeared above the water
of the lake.","September 29, 1907 : Houdini leaps into a lake heavily handcuffed and shackled, escaping death. He writes about his life and career in a full page spread."

capture of the Lindbergh baby kid

mands for prompt action by con

who called attention to the Lind
bergh baby abduction.
Senator Barbour Rep., N. J. who

while Representative Seger Rep.,
N. J. made a similar plea from the
floor of the house.
The house postoffice committee
acted promptly today on a measure
aimed at kidnapers, reporting out
thte bill of Representative Cochrane

of twenty years in jail and $5,000
fine for sending threatening, black

the mail.
Senator Bingham Rep., Conn.,
a close friend of the Lindberghs,
said the kidnaping “brings vividly

curb this growing crime.”
Senator King Dem.. Utah, a
member of the senate judiciary

2.—Charles Augustus Lind
bergh Jr., blue-eyed and fair
haired, 20-months-old child of
Colonel and Mrs. Lindbergh is
held today for $50,000 ran
som.
Seized in his crib Tuesday night
as he lay slumbering and ill of a
cold, the baby was taken away by
kidnapers, one of whom is believed
to be a woman.
With cold daring, the actual kid
napers crept up a short sectional
ladder into the second-floor nur-j
sery some time between 7:30 and
10 p. m., took the child down the
ladder, and left behind the ransom j
demand, a note dropped in the
empty crib.
Lindy Willing to ray
Colonel Lindbergh is willing to
pay the kidnapers the ransom they
demand, it was stated authorita
tively here today, “if they will make
known the means and the occasion !
lor so doing.”
The note, demanding the $50,000
for the childs freedom, was report
ed to have said in substance:
“We will be back tomorrow
Wednesday to talk business. Dont
talk to the police or the papers. i
Colonel Lindbergh, grim and re
ticent, aided in searching for the
kidnapers, and was represented as
ready personally to enter direct ne
gotiations for the childs return.
Sensation Is World-Wide
Meantime, the kidnaping created
a world-wide sensation.
Literally thousands of police and
state troopers were put oh alarm
guard, watching highways, and
state and national boundary lines.
Over the teletype wires of the
eastern .states and up along the
Canadian border flashed word that i
one of the nations most famous
babies had been stolen.
The kidnaper apparently had not
realized the furore and resentment
their deed would cause.
Police everywhere went to work
with a will to come up with the
kidnapers, while the federal depart
ments of justice, commerce and
treasury in Washington offered to
do all within their power to track
down the criminals.
President Hoover manifested his
interest..
Aviators from many parts of the
country offered their services, and
an air comrade was sent aloft this
morning to see if from the skies
he could see anything along the
roadways of valuue to the search.
The commerce department was
ready also to help with pilots.
Colonel Leads in Search
Colonel Lindbergh, worn by the
anxiety of his predicament, worked
side by side with the state police.
During the night he helped to trace |
down tracks on his property in the |
fastnesses of the Sourland moun

Dislike for Strangers
May Betray Abductors
By United firess
MEADVILLE. Pa.. March 2.—Strong resemblance of Charles
Augustus Lindbergh Jr. to his father, and his “hearty dislike of
strangers” may lead to early return of the child, his grand-aunt,
Mrs. Hilda Morrow- Mellvaine, Meadville, sister of the late Dwight
Morrow believes.
•The baby looks so much like his father that no one could mis
take his identity,” Mrs. Mellvaine said. -And he heartily dislikes
strangers.
""I know he will cry and fuss and be unmanageable with his
kidnapers, possibly betraying them.
“He is unusually bright, walking and talking in a way far be
yond his twenty months. His aunt, Miss Elizabeth Morrow, takes
him to her nursery school in Englewood, N J., frequently.
“After his first shyness he was at ease in the kindergarten,
playing w-ith older boys and girls. He even learned to count to five.
“He can walk faster than many adults. He has some clever
little tricks, too, such as talking on the telephone. If he ever gets
into a room where there is a telephone he will persist in taking dow-n
th receiver, perhaps giving the operator a clew to his presence.”
in a fast car and came back a cou
ple of hours later on foot through
the woods.
Rumor had it that they had vis
ited Flagtown where a group of sus
pected bootleggers were believed
to be.
Meantime. Mrs. Lindbergh, deep
ly stirred, bore up with the cour
age of a Spartan mother.
The first word prostrated her, but
it was not long before she was ex
hibiting the same courage as her
husband, and she helped authorities.
Once she joined searchers for a
short period.
Many Clews Traced
Her burden was all the greater
for she had been nursing the child
several days because of a cold. And
the kidnapers, without even trying
to catch up some quilts, dragged
the baby off, clad only in its “sleep
er.” Moreover, Mrs. Lindbergh is
again an expectant mother.
Many clews were run down, only
to end disappointingly.
Before dawn, a Philadelphia truck
driver reported sighting beside the
rcadway, not fan. from the Lind
bergh home, a bundle which ap
peared similar to a baby or a doll.
Troopers hurried to the scene on
fast motorcycles, but found that all
the man had seen was a bundle of
papers.
More than a dozen motor cars
were reported stolen in New Jersey
yesterday, and these were checked
in the hope of furnishing a clew.
The only one which appeared
hopeful was an abandoned car
found near Hillside, N. J—a car
stolen from a Brooklyn man. Its
headlights were streaming, and it
matched description of a blue Nash
sedan in which two men at dark
Tuesday inquired at Princeton for
the way to the Lindbergh estate.
Dog Fails to See Abductors
Police thought the inquiries might
have been the kidnapers or their
advance men. But they were at a
loss to reconcile this with evidence
that the kidnapers were familiar
with the field in which they op
erated.
A faithful dog, always alert, made
no sound, as far as is known, dur
ing the visit of the kidnaper to
the nursery on the second floor.
The man may have made friends
earlier with the animal.
The kidnaping visit was well
timed. The baby had been put to
bed and Mrs. Lindbergh had kissed
him good-night at about 7:30.
Later in the evening, the nurse
maid, Betty Gow, was startled to
find the crib empty, and the child
nowhere to be found. She gave
the alarm, and then the authorities
were summoned.
But by this time the kidnaper
had a good start.
The ladder the kidnaper used
HOME
TWO CENTS
yielded little help. Evidently he
had been gloved, and his feet either
were stockinged or his shoes cov
ered to blur the shoeprint.
The ladder had cracked as he
came down, and there is a chance
he fell, injuring himself and the
child.
Had Woman Accomplice
His tracks led out of the estate
toward the main road, where a
womans footprints appeared. This
gave the clews that the kidnapers
had a woman accomplice, who
should watch over the baby until
l such time as they could bargain for
for their ransom.
A chisel was found in the woods
near the house, but there was noth
ing to link that definitely with the
: crime.
Workmen who had helped to re
build the natural rock house on the
mountainside were checked over to
! see if they had knowledge of any
i prowlers, but so far as police re
| vealed there was nothing yielded,
i All the present and past employes
were said to have been exonerated.
Beside the press and photograph
ers, there came scores of autos with
the curious, and these jammed the
roads nearby for several miles.
The milkman arrived at 10:30
a. m., evidently unaware of the kid
naping, and delivered four quarts
of milk and two pints of cream,
most of which was for the little
baby.
Mrs. Dwight W. Morrow, mother
of Mrs. Lindbergh, arrived at the.
Lindberg home early this morning
to be with her daughter. She mo
tored down from her home at En
glewood and declined to comment
on the kidnaping as she entered the
big stone house.
Fears Child Will Suffer
“The poor child has had a cold
and will suffer,” Mrs. Lindbergh said
broken-hearted. “We have been
doctoring him for several days.”
Colonel Lindbergh, quiet but
manifestly suffering from terrific
strain, said he suspected no one, and
observed:
“They must have got through
that window” pointing to a
screened window which would not
close because it was warped.
Baby Lindbergh was tucked in his
crib at 7:30 p. m. His mother kissed
him good night, after trying vainly
to fasten a loose, warped screen in
the nursery on the second floor.
About 10 p. m. the nursemaid
entered to see that her charge
was sleeping soundly. She found
to her horror that his crib
was empty. She though at first he
might have fallen or crawled out.
But a search of the room soon
showed her that he had been stolen.
She screamed to the Lindberghs.
The police know only that the in
truder had used a ladder, put up
in sections, had scaled it into the
nursery, and there left a note—a
ransom demand for $50,000; then
had scrambled .down the ladder,
making his way to a point down
“Featherbed Lane” toward the main
highway.
Joined by Woman
On this path, according to foot
prints, the kidnaper was joined by
a woman accomplice.
The spot where the kidnaping
took place is remote, situated up a
rocky roadway off a main thorough
fare.
Olie Whateley, chauffeur-butler,
was convinced the kidnaping had
been planned carefully. This con
viction arose from the fact that a
fox terrier, usually alert, was not
heard to make any disturbance dur
ing the evening, leading to the be
lie that the intruder perhaps was
someone the dog recognized.

HOPEWELL, N. J., May 13. New
Jersey authorities, backed by the mighty
police power of the federal government, to
day apparently were on the direct trail of the
kidnapers and murderers of the Lindbergh
baby.
Shortly after President Hoover had
called on the government heads to make the
murder of the baby “a live and never-to-be
forgotten case,* it dramatically was revealed
that Colonel Lindberghs emissaries had been
in actual contact with the men believed with
out question to be the kidnapers.
The revelation came through Dr. John
F. Condon, the “Jafsie of the want ads,” who
paid out $50,000 for Colonel Lindbergh to the
kidnapers, and was double-crossed.
Under examination by authorities, he
disclosed that the men had sent as a “token”
of identification for Colonel Charles A. Lind
bergh the sleeping suit they had taken from
the kidnaped child.
Relentless Hunt Is Pushed
lhe suit convinced Lindbergh the men had the
baby and the money was paid, although the little vic
tims body then was lying in the rain soaked Jersey
woods.
Authorities, at last, on a definite trail, are no long
er hampered by the previous fear the baby would be
harmed, have started relentlessly on the trail of those
with whom Condon dealt.
They have as first clew the message from the
gang to Jafsie, and the knowledge of their w-here
abouts on the night the money was paid in the bronx.
Condon and John Hughes Curtis, the Norfolk
negotiator, moreover are expected to furnish other
information that would guide police to the killers,
now the object of the most relentless and widespread
hunt in the history of crime.

Baby Lindbergh's crib became the symbol of a nation's grief as
word was flashed from Hopewell of*the discovery of the child's body

the manufacturer's serial number on a lapel on the collar.
Through this number Lindbergh traced it to the store
where the baby's clothes had been purchased.
He felt then Condon was in contact with the kidnapers,
and the $50,000 was paid out.
When the baby was kidnaped, it wore three garments—
a flannel belly hand, a flannel undershirt and the sleeping
garment. The sleeping garment was missing from the body.
Marshalls revelations recalled one of the series of news
paper advertisements through which Condon communicated
with the kidnapers. It said. “The package had been received''
and that “the party"" considered it “the real goods.""
Betty Go\\. who viewed the mutilated body and positive
ly identified it as the Lindbergh baby, was positive because
of the undershirt on the body when it was found.
It had been too long for the baby and she had cut off the
end and sewed a hem with blue thread, Marshall said.
Discovery of the pitiful, mutilated corpse, with the skull
crushed, at Mount Rose Hill Thursday afternoon, less than
five miles from the Lindbergh home, horrified the nation.
The child for which the world has been searching for
two and a half months was murdered soon after the kidnap
ing—perhaps on the night of the kidnaping itself.
Mrs. Lindbergh was at home when they brought her the
news. Her grief and shock were hidden from the world, al
though she was said to be bearing up bravely within the
closely-guarded Sourland hills home the Lindberghs had built.
It had been planned as a safe retreat in which to rear
their child and have their home life.

WASHINGTON, May 13. President
Hoover today issued orders to the secret
service of the federal government to “make
the kidnaping and murder of the Lindbergh
baby a live and never-to-be-forgotten case.”
The President, in a brief, terse state
ment, ordered the federal government
agencies never to relax “until those criminals
are implacably brought to justice.”
The Presidents statement said:
“I have directed the law enforcement
agencies and the several secret services of
the federal government to make the kidnap
ing and murder of the Lindbergh baby a live
and never-to-be-forgotten case, never to be
relaxed until those criminals are implacably
brought to justice.”
Sends Message of Condolence
The Presidents message was flashed immediately
to all the governments law enforcement agencies, and
sudden activity ran like magic through the depart
ments concerned.
Attorney-General William Mitchell, arriving at
the White House for the Friday cabinet meeting, said
he had relayed the Presidents message “to all the en
forcement agencies under my command.
President Hoover also dispatched a message of
condolence to the Lindbergh family.
The President's order throws into tho case not only the
department of justice and its various agencies, the prohibi
tion bureau, the treasury secret service and the coast guard,
all the army of the United States, marshals and other govern
ment forces, but conceivably even could extend to the use
of the army and navy intelligence services which extend to
almost every corner of the earth.
Trained Detectives Are Available
One important phase of the federal activity periainet
to the $50,000 in notes paid by Lindbergh in the ransom hoax.
Secret service men have been pursuing clews with all
the deftness and skill accumulated during a long period of
success in this field of detection.
' It was regarded as highly improbable that the trained
investigators assigned to the case would fail to get result*.
Passage of federal legislation which at least could reach kidnapers
who take advantage of present deficiencies in laws by fleeing from one
state to another seemed certain.
Senator Roscoe C. Patterson 'Rep.. Mo., author of a bill before the
senate Judiciary committee, said that “nothing now can stop Its passage.'
Then. 72 days after the kidnaping. Colonel H Norman Schwarzkopf
summoned newspapermen to the garage on the Lindbergh estate.
There, with doors locked, telephones silenced, so that none might
give premature announcement to an eager world. Colonel Schwarz
kopf read the formal police statement announcing that the baby a
body had been found by William Allen, a Negro, in a gulley on
Mount Bose hill, near Mount Rose. N. J.. approximately four
and one-half miles from the Lindbergh estate. From baby cloth
ing obtained from the Lindbergh home, the body was definitely
identified as that of baby Lindy.

She remained behind the locked
doors while the friends pleaded
with her to come out.
In her room on the eighth floor
of t[ie Hotel Stacy-Trent, could i
be heard the cry of newsboys J
shouting extras that ""Bruno is:
dead.""
She lay prostrate on the hed
when word of the execution came.
Mrs. Hauptmann, her hair dis

""Oh, niy God!"" she shouted.
""Oh why did you do this to hini!""|
Or. William Collier tried to ad-j
minister to her. She pushed him
away, screaming:
""They've killed him! They ve
murdered him!""
Suddenly she leaped from the
bed and writhed on the floor. Her
friends tried to lift her. She broke
away, dashed into the bathroom'
and locked the door. 1
Previously as a precautionary
measure, the bathroom had been
cleared of all glass and towels.
Some of her companions be

efforts to get her out.
Ten minutes later, the Rev. Dr.

from the prison. He went to the
door of the bathroom and spoke
quietly. Finally, she opened the
door.
She sobbed convulsively.
""Oh Richard, my poor, poor

The minister finally succeeded
in quieting her.
Mrs. Hauptmann. through a

TRENTON, N. J., April 4.—
UP—The slate of New Jersey,
which sper.t $1,200,000 to capture
and convict Bruno Richard Haupt
mann, executed thim last night
with a penny s worth of electric
ity.
Hauptmann entered the door of
the death house at i-tate prison at
8:41 p. m.
The first of three shocks went
through his body at 8:42 1-2.
Physicians pronounced him dead
at 8:47 1-2 p. in.
Before his body ever hung loose
and heavy against the straps of
the electric chair, officials collect
ed from witnesses a dozen affi
davits, swearing that Hauptmann
had died in the place, time and
manner prescribed by law. Then
they closed their four-year file on
the murder of Charles A. Lind
bergh, Jr.
Hauptmann died without con
fessing.
Not a word passed his lips as he
entered the electrocution chamber
and he needed no assistance when
he sat down in the chair.
Nothing that a man covets —
money, security for his family,
not even the prospects of escap
ing the thunderbolt that hit him
last night—could persuade Haupt
mann to tell why and how and
he kUUd Liodbsrgh
baby.
His failure to confess left a
trail of doubt around the world.
Millions, including the governor
of New Jersey, believed no one
man could have committed the
crime, and that the law did only
part of its work on the spring eve
ning four years and a month from
the night when the Lindbergh
baby was kidnaped.
For these millions, a murdered
child still cries out for vengeance
and they will believe through all
their years that sometime and
somewhere a frightened m in is
?oing to whisper from his r'c? h
bed that he, too, had a part in the
bloody business on Sourland
mountain.
But when Hauptmann walked
to his death he did so in the
knowledge that his lawyers and
his wife, Anna, had tried and test
ed every safeguard' of the law and
that he still stood convicted and
guilty.
For one breathless fragment of
a minute last night every heart
stood still in the little white-wall
ed room where death and Haupt
mann met. It was when the door
swung.
There stood tiauptmann s
For five beats of your heart he
did not move, but waited for the
door to come wide enough for him
and his guards to get through.
It was his eyes yoli noticed
first. They were strange, unblink
ing eyes—cold eyes of washed-out
blue.
They had dressed him for death
in a gray shirt open at the throat,
in shapeless brown trousers and
bedroom slippers. At first glance,
only his eyes identified him as be
ing the man who sat directly in
front of the United Pi-ess cor
respondent at FlentSr^ton dur
ing the six weeks of his trial.
They had clipped the hair of his
skull, and it gleamed, white and
hard ?n the light.
Robert Elliott, the executioner,
stood beside a bucket of brine in
which he was soaking the sponges
to be u:M?d on Houptmann—a
wrinkled old mechanic of death,
puttering around with his tool?.
Thw were more than 60 persons
crowded into one corner of the
room, hut if Hauptmann saw
them th*y must, have been noth
ing but a blur of face* to him.
Only one thing stands out dark
and stark in that white room—
the oak chair with its heavy
leather straps.
And that chair was the fir?1
thing Hauptmann saw aa he canu
through the door with a guard
grasping each arm. It was not the
first time he had looked death in
the eye. He saw it down tbc stun
by barrel of a machine gun dur
ing the World war; saw it coming
at him across the fields in the
shape of men dressed in French
horizon bltse and British brown.
But he couki fight back st death
then, give it blow for blow and
come through, as he did, un
scathed. There was no fighting
back now, and he knew it.
His face was pasty, mayba with
fright and maybe only with the
pallor that prison puts on men
who never see the sun. He seemed
to have courage, if courage means

tion fame, can be made tonight on indisputable authority.

Women Were to Be Questioned.
Irey, chief of the Internal Revenue Bu- j
reaus intelligence unit, was ready not only,
to tender Uncle Sam's aid in recovering
Charles Augustus, jr., but to question the i
women as to their connection with the case. |
Through it all Col. Lindbergh held to a de
termination to play fair with the kidnapers
if they kept faith with him under the solemn
contract entered into by Jafsle in the melo
dramatic surroundings of a graveyard.
In accordance with this “code of honor”
Lindbergh requested Irey and his two “aces.”
Frank Wilson and A. P. Madden, to remain
aw'ay from the actual scene of the $50,000
ransom transaction, but permitted Irey to
join in the climactic quest for the baby and
its “guiltless” guardians.
Respects 8-Hour Start Demand.
The kidnapers had demanded eight hours start after payment 1
of the ransom, and Lindbergh, not suspecting a trick, allowed that I
period to expire before he launched the hunt for the Nellie off Cutty- I

to Dr. Condon April 1 It was half
of an infant's sleeping dress. Col. and
Mrs. Lindbergh and Betty Gow. the
nurse, were convinced after careful ex
amination of the garment that it was,
as Jafsie said in a newspaper advertise
ment, “the real article.""
Stakes All on Pledges.
Without waiting to press further his
reiterated requests for the babys flnger
; prints, for comparison with a set of
! latent"" prints obtained from toys and
! furniture in the nursery, Lindbergh,
with the advice of others, decided to
pin all his hopes on the pledges of
those who had stolen his son.
The babys garment was delivered on
Friday, April 1. The ransom was paid
the next night by Dr. Condon, who
handed to a shadowy figure behind a
cemetery wall a box containing the
$50,000 in five, ten and twenty dollar
bills. Most of the circumstances of that
transaction already have become public.

the $50,000 in a box. then drove to the
eerie rendezvous with the emissary of

designated in the letter soon was recog
nized, with a concerted cry of elation.
All eyes were strained for a glimpse
of the yacht called ""Nellie.""
But the Nellie was not there.
Nearby, however, could be seen a
number of boats, scattered along the
inlets and bays.
Search in Vain.
Lindbergh zoomed down again and
again, until it seemed the undercarriage
cf the plane would clip the rigging of
the boats beneath, or touch the sun
tinted waters of the sound. He was try
ing to read the names on the sides of
the craft that seemed to answer the |
general description of the Nellie. I
There were yachts with a wide variety i
of girls' names, except that sought.
Grimly. Lindbergh and his associates j
continued the disheartening search.
The plane circled the Island and ven- '
tured to ether nearby shores of the !
Marthas Vineyard area. It was hopi-d I
the Nellie would see or hear the !
plane and signal to It In some way. j
Perhaps those on the yacht had mis
understood directions of their own j
group and were in the wrong location, j
If this were the case it would be ad- j
visable to cover a wide territory.
With ever-increasing misgivings, the ]
plane continued to circle over the j
neighborhood. At ope time the plane
was landed at the village of Cuttyhunk
and the group went ashore and Inquired
of the seafaring folk there whether they
knew anything of the Nellie.
No one had heard of such a boat In
that vicinity.
Lindbergh Recognized.
Lunch was eaten in the village. It
was during this visit to the town that
Lindbergh was recognized by several of
the residents. One of the villagers
noticed the name ""Breckinridge"" on a
wallet. It was in this way that word
of the flight first leaked out. It was
not until later that Dr. Condon s
identity was disclosed, and the fourth
man has been variously reported as
having been John H. Curtis. Norfolk
""intermediary"": John Fogarty, private
detective, and others.
Lindbergh refused to give up hope.
All day long he wheeled the plane over
Cuttyhunk and Marthas Vineyard. Onlv |
the darkening shadows of eventide in - |
duced him to call the expedition off j
for the day.
Crushed with pent-up emotion, the
searchers returned sorrowfully to New
York that night.
Lindbergh could not bring himself to
believe he had been deliberately double
crossed He argued there must have
been some unintentional slip In the ar
rangements.
Second Flight Made.
Tlie first thing Monday he and Col.
Brecken ridge again flew back to Cutty
hunk and renewed the quest. This trip,
too ended in failure.
Meanwhile Dr. Condon eagerlv had
been awaiting word from his ""contact
man.” Tuesday passed, with no message
of anv kind from those who had taken
the $50,000.
On Wednesday. April 6, Lindbergh
was prevailed upon to take decisive ac
tion He had Dr. Condon insert the ad
vertisement asking ""What Is wrong.
Have you crossed me?” and he furnished
the Treasury with a list of serial num
bers of the ransom bills.
So far the answer to Jafsie's ad has
been complete, poignant silence.
Directions to Yacht Given.
Dr. Condon was handed an envelop
containing explicit directions as to the
baby's whereabouts. It was in the same
handwriting as that of other letters
which played a part in the negotiations
and it matched the writing in the
original ransom note.
The letter instructed Lindbergh to fly
to Cuttyhunk. a small island off the
“elbow'' of Cape Cod and near Marthas
Vineyard. In a certain location along
the shore of Cuttyhunk. carefully de
scribed so there could be no mistake, it
was asserted a 30-foot yacht, with
“Nellie' painted on her bow, would be
found.
On the boat, the letter said, there
were two women in whose care the baby
had been placed. These women, it was
stated, were innocent of any complicity
in the kidnaping, and Lindbergh's word
was asked that they come to no harm.
Lindbergh fully intended to do every
thing in his power to grant that plea.
In the event that anything went
wrong with the plans, however, Lind
bergh wranted a Federal officer avail
able. Several possibilities of a slip-up
had been suggested to him. There was
the possibility the yacht would be
found, with the women aboard, but no
baby there. In this event Lindbergh
would have felt fully justified in hav
ing the women subjected to a grueling
interrogation.
Conflicting Emotions.
The wave of conflicting emotions that
followed reading of the letter of in
I struction can only be imagined by those
j not present. Hope fought and con
' quered the specter of fear that lurked
i in the thoughts of the little coterie
j privileged to be in on events leading

Flemington, N. J., Feb. 14.— JT
—Bruno Hauptmann, manacled
and listening to his doom, was
silent.
Bruno Hauptmann went back
to his cell in the Hunterdon coun
ty jail, broke down and wept.
Hearing jury and judge order
him put to death as the killer of
the Lindbergh baby, the Bronx
carpenter spoke only to comfort
his wife.BRUNO RICHARD HAUPTMANN
“Its all right. Annie,"" he said.
But in the loneliness, the
pseudo-privacy of prison which
has been his lot for five months,
he mumbled unintelligible Ger
man phrases.
Under state law, he will be held
here at least until 11 p. m., Fri
day. Then, 48 hours, having ex
pired since the warrant for his
removal was issued, he may be
taken to the death house at Tren
ton.

Hauptmann's garage belongs to Col*
onel Lindbergh, who paid $50,000 ran
som. He is not likely to get it back
until the state is positive it will no|
need it as evidence in a new trial.
Prison precedent combined with'
judge and jury to fix the night of
March 22 as the tentative for
Hauptmann's electrocution.
He was sentenced to “suffer death”
the week of March 18. and Friday is
doomsday in the death house at Tren
ton.
Edward J. Reilly said an appeal
would be carried to the United States
supreme court if necessary.
The first tribunal expected to hear
the plea, the state court of errors and
appeals, meets for its next term late
in May. The court of pardons will
not hear it before October.
The Jurors who sentenced him
showed more emotion than did
Hauptmann as he stood before them
at 10:45 p. m. Wednesday.
With a look of affection, the 36-
year-old prisoner turned to his faith
ful wife and said:
“It's all right, Annie.”
Back in his cell, out of the gaze of
the curious, Hauptmann burst into
tears.
The jurors required more than 11
hours to reach their verdict. They
were closely guarded after the case
ended, but a courthouse report was
that two of the women had held out
for a recommendation of mercy. That
would have meant a life sentence.
There was no mention of mercy
when the jury was polled.
With stuttering words Foreman
Charles Walton, Sr., announced the
verdict. He who had listened to the
evidence for more than six weeks
even twisted the defendants name in
his fight to remain calm.
“Guilty,” he announced. “We finq
the defendant, Richard Bruno Haupt
mann, guilty of murder in the first
degree.”
An insignificant piece of paper
rustled in his trembling hands. He
glanced at the paper with unseeing
eyes in pretense of consulting it.
A few strides away stood Haupt
mann, jaw set, face so pale and hag
gard it was ghastly in the electric
light. Sharply erect, he tottered
slightly as he heard the foremans
words.
Jadga Imposes Sentence
A few minutes later Justice Thomas
W. Trenchard quietly imposed sen
tence.

nap trail. It began In Fsatharbed

1, 1932, when the wind was bowling
over the lonely Sourland Mountain
on which OoL Charles A. Lindbergh
made his home. It ended in a prosaic,
rural courtroom Uttered with papers
and clgaret stubs.
Thirteen times the death dealing
verdict was recited, on the thirteenth
day of the month.
After Walton had made known the
decision, the court dark sated:

WASHINGTON, Jan. 16 Prohibi

the United States today. Ratification
of the federal amendment by the Ne
braska legislature made that measure
the eighteent amendment to the fed
eral constitution.
All but a half dozen of the forty
eight states are expected to adopt the
amendment in the next few weeks, but
the action of Nebraska today gives the
ratification of thre-fourths of the
states, the number necessary to ad
minister John Barleycorn the k. o.
punch.
One year from today every saloon,
brewery, distillery and wine press in
the land must close its doors unless
as now seems likely, they are already
closed at that time by war prohibi
tion, which goes into effect next July
1, and stays until completion of de
mobilization. The amendment which outlaws li
quor in this country reads:
Section 1. After one year from the
ratification of this article, the manu
facture, sale or transportation of In
toxicating liquor within, the importa
tion thereof into, or the exportation
thereof from the United States and all

ified as an amendment to the consti
tution by the legislature of the sev
eral states as provided by the con
stitution within seven years of the
date of submission thereof to the states
by Congress.
This is the amendment adopted by
Congress December 18, 1917, and rati
fied by thirty-six states a little more
than a year later.
And these are some of the things
that the amendment will do:
Wipe out a stroke 236 distilleries;
992 breweries and over 300,000 saloons
and wholesale liquor establishments,
forcing thir employes to seek other
jobs.
Cut off from these persons annual
incomes totalling more than $70,000,
000 in pre-war times.
Cut off from the United States treas
ury a source of taxation counted upon
for an even billion dollars in their
first drafts in the new revenue bill
and millions in additional income to
state treasuries.
Remove the liquor question from na
tional, ate and city pontics for all
times and help increase city, state
and federal expense by decreasing law
violations.
The fight on liquor, triumphant to
day is as old as the constitution it
self. It raised its head early In the nine

as another crank notion.
But it gathered strength. Churches
took it up, doctors followed and then
came the organization of anti-liquor
societies, the anti-saloon league an1
others.

BIO FIRES ARE NOW-FREQUENT
Week after next tho Kentucky
Legislature will convene and the
eyes of tho country will be turned
this way, as this toody will bo the
first to act on the new prohibition
law just passed in Washington.
Those familiar with the affairs of
this State realize that tho coming
Legislature is practically committed
fo a prohibition amendment, but Its
action will toe heralded broadcast by
the Prohibitionists that Kentucky is
anxious to go into the dry column
and is more than half way ready
to adopt the constitutional amend
ment as submitted by Congress
and tho Senate. All of tho
Kentucky leaders of Democracy
from Gov. Stanley down are
In favor of submitting tho
question of State-wide prohibition tp
the people, and regardless of the
action of our .national bodies it Is
hoped that the people of Kentucky
will be given an opportunity to
register their opposition to this
narrow-minded and fanatical meas
ure. One consoling thought to the
people of this State will be that this
legislation marks the passing of the
hypocrites and fakers who have
made Frankfort their headquarters
at every legislative session. The
usual figure-heads of this clan are
the down-and-out country preach
ers who; not able to secure a
church or congregation, use prohibi
tion as their means of making a
livelihood. They are assisted by
tho narrow-minded fanatics who
are insane on the subject, and last
but not least the wily politician, who
uses the Anti-saloon Leaguers and
the Prohibitionists to further his
political ends.
Kentucky has been cursed with
prohibition politics for tho past sev
eral years and it will toe a relief to
have tho question settled by the
people. There has hardly been a
Democratic political convention or
primary that Haly and Beckham
have not held the bugaboq prohibi
tion up to control the party, and
good men have been driven from
active service because they could
not seo their way clear to ,hark
back to tho days of Salem wlth
craft and Puritan fanaticism. In
their places sprung up unknown,
obscure and Incompetent Demo
cratic leaders, under the guise of
Forward Leaguers, who presumed
to dictato to tho party as a whole.
The passage of the prohibition
amendment means, back to ob
scurity for them, unless they Join
the anti-tobacco reformers, who
hope to follow in tho footsteps of
the Prohibitionists. In tho Re
publican party stirring old leaders
like Senator Bradley and ex-Go v.
Willson have been succeeded by the
Republican Prohibitionists like Hert,
ORear, Bruner and Morrow, all of
whom are advocates of down with
the demons rum, beer and wine,
and probably unintentional advo
cates of the soft drink dope syrups.
Thus tooth political parties .will be
in tho humor for a house cleaning
after the prohibition question is
settled.

Washington, Aug. 1.? A six-year race
to make this a bone-dry country was
set going to-day, when the Senate by
a vote of ?i to 20 decided tt submit
a national prohibition amendment to
the states. This amendment must be
ratified by three-fourths of the states
within six years after it has been sub-:
mitted.
Tho six-year period w-,11 not begin
until the House of Representatives has
also passed by a two-thirds majority
the re.jolutior., but that this will be
done is not doubted by the most en
thusiastic wets. The highest hope of
the wets now to stave off the vote
:n the House until next session. The
House has until the expiration of the
present Congre??, on March I, lJl>, to
pass the amendment, so to nullify to
days action in the Senate the wets
would have to stave off a vote in the
House until after that date.
Senators said o-night that this is the
first time in the countrys history that
a constitutional amendment. hns ever
had a time limit string to it. Thirty
six states. the necessary three-fourths
to ratify a constitutional amendment,
must have approved the bone-dry
amendment within six years following
the date the resolution is flnally passed
by both houses or it will fall to th
grcund. If, six years after the House
nas passed the amendment adopted by
the Senate to-dav, only thirty-tive or
fewer states shali have approved it, all
the work done in getting the resolution
through I ongress and in getting those
thirty-nve legislatures to ratify it will
be lost.
Flght To Be Transferrcd
So the passage of the resolution bv
the House, which is eonceded to be
coraing, whethei this session or next,
will transfer the flght of the pro-
hibition forces to the state legi?-
iatures. The real battle will lie in a
tew states. It is probable, for in
stanre that but little atten.ion will be
wasfd on such states as New York
and \?w Jersey. The drys virtualiy
have twcnty-flve sure states states
which nrf now bone dry or nearly so,
Bt that they will only have to make an
upbill battle in eleven additional states
to ratify the amendment.
Ono or the bijrgr?t surprises of the
day was not he vote on the final
adoption of the amendment, though
this was much larger than expected,
but the vote on r.n amendment by Sen?
ator Nevlar.ils. This would have made
the prohibition against -distilled
liquors, insiead of intoxicating
liquors, and would have saved light
wines and beer. It was defcated, 67 I
to 22.
Hy practically tha same vote tho
Senate refused to adopt a plan of Sen
Bttl Pnelan, of California, which would
have given the state legislatures the
right to pass either on a bone dry
amendn ent, or one prohibiting mereiy
diatilled liquors.
Senator Stone, of Missouri, one of
the prnnouncvl opponents of prohibi?
tion, trtatod the Scm.t BBd fralleries
to another surpr.se. Waiting until the
clerk was reading the list of how the
Senators had voted. he \oted for the
r.m.endment. At once his col!eag-je,
Senator Reed. another pronouneed anti
prohibitioni-t, rushed to his desk.
After a hurried confab, he stood up
and addressed the Chair. He voted no.
This does not rcprcsent a conversion
on Mr. Stones part, but mereiy his
idea hat the states should have the
right to determine the question.","August 1, 1917 : The Senate passes a resolution to present a constitutional amendment prohibiting the sale or consumption of alcohol to the states for ratification."

https://guides.loc.gov/chronicling-america-prohibition,https://www.loc.gov/item/13019196/,1,"ADDRESS OF GOVERNOR W. R. STUBBS OF KANSAS, 
AT CHICAGO, SUNDAY, MARCH 27. 

In Which He Tells What Constitutional Prohibition Has Done for Kansas, 
Giving a Great Many Documents in Support of His Argument. 

I came to Chicago to defend the fair name of Kansas against the slanders of 
those whose interest it is to see our laws violated, our civilization defamed and 
our state policies impeached. 

I am going to furnish you and the country exact and indisputable facts 
concerning the enforcement and operation of the prohibition law in Kansas. 
The proof which I shall submit to you would be accepted as conclusive evidence 
before any court in the United States. 

I am anxious to know whether the good people of Chicago are willing to 
credit the statemn ;s of a combination of brewers and saloonkeepers who are 
spending hundred? of thousands of dollars annually to poison public opinion, 
and debauch t^e iaw in preference to the statements of those who are standing 
up for : 1, American home, working and pleading for decency in public life and 
making effo; ; in every direction to build up a great state on the foundation of a 
wholesome morality. 

I did not come here as a politician, for I have never yet had either the time 
or the inclination to iearn the laws or tricks of scientific politics. 

1 have never made a prohibition speech in my life. I am a practical, plain- 
speaking business man and while I regard the moral and sentimental sides of 
the question as constituting its strongest claim on society for support I propose, 
to a very large extent, to discuss the subject from a cold-blooded, economic 
standpoint. In other words, I am going to present it to you as a sound business 
proposition. 

When I was a candidate for governor in 1908 I made the campaign for my 
nomination and election on the proposition that if elected to this office every 
saloon, joint and place of every kind whatever regardless of the sentiment of 
the community had to be closed. This proposition was made in my campaign 
speeches to the saloon men in wet communities as well as to temperance 
people; I stated publicly all over Kansas — in Pittsburg in the mining districts 
as well as the localities where the law was enforced — that any man who estab- 
lished himself in the saloon business in violation of the laws and constitution 
of Kansas would be regarded the same as any other outlaw, and all the power 
and force of the state government would be used to punish and destroy his 
business. 

This does not mean that we have no violations of the prohibitory law, 
for if there were no violations such a law would not be necessary. It does 
mean that the prohibitory law in Kansas is as well enforced as other criminal 
statutes, and that when men violate it they are arrested, convicted and promptly 
sent to prison. 

The United States government has taken a step which will aid materially in 
stamping out the irresponsible bootlegger and whiskey vender who now is 
the principal violator of the prohibitory law in Kansas. Under direction of 
President Taft the Attorney General of the United States has ordered United 
States district attorneys in  dry territory not to compromise with men who 
violate the internal revenue laws by permitting them to pay fines, but to prose- 
cute them and send them to jail for a reasonable time. 

I want to especially impress the fact upon your mind that while Kansas had 
substantial prohibition for twenty-eight years it has had absolute prohibition 
only since May, 1909. Previous to this time liquor was allowed to be sold 
through licensed pharmacists, for medicinal, mechanical and scientific purposes. 
Abuse of this privilege led to dissatisfaction and the last legislature wiped out 
all exceptions and made the state absolutely dry. Before they could sell 
intoxicating liquors these pharmacists had to obtain an internal revenue stamp 
and it is upon this circumstance in part that the agents and spokesmen of the 
breweries and the distilleries are trying to deceive you by showing the number 
of so-called licenses issued in Kansas last year. 

A further explanation of the number of licenses issued in Kansas is found 
in the method of handling violators of the Federal stamp law. When our state 
officers arrest a man for selling liquor they notify the internal revenue officers, 
who come to him at once and collect a Federal license tax, often times finding 
the man in jail. This man is then quoted by the breweries, distilleries and sa- 
loon men of other- states as a saloonkeeper in Kansas, when in fact he is either 



in jail, paroled during good behavior, or under injunction never to again engage 
in liquor selling in our state. 

Under our state law the finding of a Federal license stamp in a place fitted 
up for the sale of intoxicating liquors is primae facie evidence of violation of 
the prohibitory law, and I challenge the brewers and distillers to show one in- 
ternal revenue liquor stamp posted in a saloon or joint in Kansas. 

While I am not an expert in the affairs of the local government of Chicago 
I venture the assertion that conditions which are due largely to the saloon and 
kindred evils of society constitute your most disturbing and distracting prob- 
lems. Usually cities having an ambition to solve such problems commission 
delegations of its wisest and best citizens to investigate the treatment of these 
problems by other communities. As chief executive of my state it would give 
me great pleasure to welcome delegations from Chicago to Kansas for the 
purpose of showing them the results of prohibition. We have had commis- 
sioners from Canada, New Zealand, England and Australia and even now the 
governments of Italy and Russia are investigating our methods of dealing with 
this evil, the greatest social and governmental problem on the face of the earth 
today. 

If wisdom should cause you to send such a delegation to Kansas I will 
guarantee they will not find a business man of standing in the state who will 
not testify that prohibition is the best business asset of Kansas. 

Prohibition must be judged by results — it must stand or fall upon its 
merits. The people of Kansas are very progressive, very positive and intensely 
practical in their ideas and habits. If the prohibitory law had not given us a 
better civilization and a higher type of manhood and womanhood it would have 
been repealed years ago. If it has increased drunkenness, crime and perjury, 
as saloon men claim it has done, the saloonkeepers would all be supporting the 
law instead of fighting it, for it would increase their revenue. 

This is .an age of conservation. Prohibiting the manufacture and sale of 
whiskey is more closely identified with a sound conservation policy than are the 
laws prohibiting the wanton destruction of the forests. ","January 17, 1920 : Legal enforcement begins"

THE LEGAL ASPECT OF PROHIBITION. 

JOHN CLEMENS BENTON. 

The prohibition movement grows apace. Indeed, it 
may be said, at last, to have attained the dignity of a 
national question. True, Congress has not as yet under- 
taken to legislate on the subject; and in fact, it has no 
power to do so &in so far as the general public is con- 
cerned& if the provisions of a seemingly obsolescent Con- 
stitution are of any force and effect whatever. True, 
also, that both of the great political parties continue to 
ignore the movement in their platforms. Nevertheless, 
ir many sections of the country it constitutes the most 
important local issue, and in all sections it is a more or 
less engrossing topic of political discussion. 

Already prohibitory liquor laws obtain in many 
States and communities, and, if we can credit current 
statistics, forty per cent, of the people of the United 
States chafe under their iniquitous and exasperating re- 
strictions. And, notwithstanding legal fictions to the con- 
trary, these laws do, in fact, deprive persons of property 
without due process of law; they do, in fact, impair the 
obligations of contracts, and they do, in fact, deprive the 
people of vested rights contrary to the letter and spirit 
of the Constitution. Moreover, they impede the growth 
and commerce of individual communities, thereby im- 
pairing the general prosperity of the Nation; they se- 
riously cripple the national revenue, and they tend to 
revolutionize the accepted theory of constitutional gov- 
ernment. 

For these reasons the question may be considered 
national, and, perhaps, the most important national ques- 
tion at present confronting the American people; the 
one of all others now pending most directly affecting the 
rights and- liberties of the people, and one upon the

          THE latest fad in the line of
          physical culture Is barrel
          rolling. Nowadays both men
          and women may be found
          who daily make It a duty to
          exercise for a certain length
          of time with a common, everyday barrel.
          Corpulent people may now rejoice, for
          this latest acquisition to the catalogue of
          health and figure improvement methods
          has been proven to do everything claimed
          for it.
          Thin, sickly people may also join th*
          chorus, for it not only reduces flesh with
          fleshy individuals, but makes flesh atd
          muscle. Improves the breathing apparatus,
          invigorates the action of the heart and
          brings about a graceful carriage.
          All the properties needed consist of ,a
          small barrel or keg. The exercise may
          be taken in a bedroom, although out of
          doors is better.
          Barrel-rolling, like all other kinds of
          exercise, must be taken In regulated!
          doses. The man who goes at It like ha
          woulJ to a fire will realize little real bene
          fit He will derive the greatest who
          makes it a business as well as a pleas
          ure, begins on a small scale and works up
          to his greatest capacity gradually and
          naturally.
          The exercises given in the following are
          prepared especially for those who are
          earnest erough to have a try with this
          new method and who will be really con-
          scientious in their work.
          For the first exercise the barrel Is laid
          on the floor on its rolling surface.' The
          body should be so arranged that only the
          tips of the fingers and the palms of the
          hands touch the floor, the greater weight
          of the body ing borne by the keg. The
          body should then be propelled forward,
          the hands being used for that, purpose.
          The legs and arms must be kept as rigid
          'as possible, and the feet must not be
          moved until the barrel, moving naturally
          downward, reaches the knee. Now re
          verse the movement, pushing backward
          with the hands until the barrel is rolled
          up to the arms. This exercise should be
          repeated several times. It is the most
          important of all for reducing the weight,
          although It tends equally with the fol
          lowing, others to develop the arms,
          broaden the chest and make the abdom
          inal muscles flexible.
          The second exercise Is practically the
          reverse of the.first. Rest with the back
          en the cask this time. Place the arms
          downward, and rest the heels on the floor
          —the heels only, mind; no other part of
          the legs. In order to get the barrel in
          motion, move the arms alternately as far
          forward as possible. The cask will then
          reach the heels, the body being raised
          from the floor. As before, reverse this
          movement and ""bring the cask up to the
          small of the back, still taking care to
          keep the legs stretched out straight.
          ""While performing this exercise, keep the
          lungs well filled, the stomach drawn in
          and the chest expanded. When the keg
          is up to the part of the back referred to
          lift th* arms from the floor and extend
          them along the side of the body.* with
          open palms on hip. Keep this position as
          long 1 as possible without strain.
          The third exercise is a pretty one. It
          la performed by lying with the left side
          of the body, just above the hip, resting
          'on the"" barrel. If you wonder why, in the
          picture, the right hand is upraised, you
          will know as soon as you begin the exer
          cise. vlt is to balance the body, for the
          feet qnly touch the floor. ""With your left
          hand pull your body forward as far as
          possible until the feet can be raised from
          the floor. This is not as easy as it looks,
          but a little perseverance will manage it.
          Then move back to the former position.
          .When this exercise has been fairly well
          jnnEtered, repeat it. but by lying on the
          richt side of the body and holding the
          hft hand in the air. This exercise is
          liable \to strain the body if it is perse
          vered In with too much zeal, and care
          should, therefore, be taken to be conser
          vative.
          The fourth movement consists of lying
          with the back on the cask, the arms, at
          first, folded. This, while appearing to be
          similar to exercise number two, is quite
          rent, for here the feet only are U3ed
          to force the body over the barrel until
          the latter has reached the shoulders anl
          back of the head, when the arms are then
          placed at the side, as in the illustration.
          As in the second exercise, do not neglect,
          while in this position, to keep the stom
          ach drawn in and the chest expanded. No
          person with a weak back should prac
          tice this movement, for the strain upon
          the neck is rather severe, and an acci
          dent might be attended with unpleasant
          consequences.
          The fifth is a fine exercise, easy, grace
          ful and at the same time beneficial. Stand
          straight up, with the feet together, stom
          ach in. chest out, shoulders square, and
          head back. Place the small barrel first
          upon the toes. Bend down and grasp hold
          of it. and bring it, not too quickly, up to
          the waist line and thence above the head.
          Hold it there for a second or two, being
          sure that your figure is perfectly
          straight. !V
          A good method of regulating the breath
          ing apparatus, the functions of which are
          rather severely drawn upon in this exer
          cise, is to count, one, two, three, four,
          etc., at each swing-up of the cask, and
          inhale air through the nostrils only at
          the even numbers, two, four, six, and so
          on.
          The sixth exercise follows naturally
          from the fifth. Raise the cask from the
          toes to the chin line, still keeping the
          body rigid, though the legs may bo
          stretched a trifle apart, to preserve the
          equilibrium, and swing the barrel to the
          right and the left alternately. Follow
          the same rules about breathing as in the
          preceding movement.
          The next exercise, the seventh, is one
          which can be done expertly only by the
          man who has Indulged in this form of
          barrel-rolling exercise for some time, but
          so many parts of the body are brought
          into play during It that nothing should
          be neglected to bring one's salf to the
          pitch of necessary ability. Stretch the
          legs so that the feet are apart about
          twenty-four inches. Then swing the bar
          rel down briskly between the legs and
          Tiigh up over the head, bending the back
          and allowing the knees to bend slightly
          forward as the barrel passes under the
          body.
          Go slowly about this exercise, for It is,
          as has been intimated, no small strain
          over the whole of the body, and it is not
          one to be performed by the weakling. Yet
          the weakling can easily get to it by prac
          ticing the previous exercises. It is a
          matter only of degree. Keep the lungs
          partly filled as you exhale, because it la
          neceesary to use the thoracic and ab
          dominal muscles, for the Improvement of
          which this exercise has been partly de
          signed.
          The cask ls placed In a novel position
          for the eighth exercise—as far a? the
          body Is concerned. That Is. one must re
          cline upon it stretched lengthwise in the
          tame direction as the body. Place th?
          hands on the floor In front and let the
          toes, the tips of which touch the ground,
          support your legs.
          Now roll from left to right, or the bar
          rel from right to left, according to the
          way of looking at It. Refrain from be
          coming too enthusiastic at this pastime,
          or the barrel will slip away from under
          you and you may flatten your face
          against the surface of the floor or
          ground.

          H around exercise is capital; no one will din
          put c that, but it is possible that certain parts
          of your anatomy require further development,
          thai may be pained by certain forms of exercise
          that bring muscles into play.
          For example, swimming develops the rniiFclc
          of the chest, arms, limbs, and abdomen, but its
          greatest benefit lies in its powcrB of increasing
          the circulation through reactionary causes. Row
          ing, also brings into active condition both nius-J
          cle aud blood.
          Tennis is a diversion more likely to bo within
          reach of the average city bred girl than any
          other, lln's will develop tho muscles of her
          arms, particularly the forearm, to a surprising
          extent. -But here let nic whisper a note of warn
          ing; play with both hands, or the one that wicldi
          the racquet will cause the left arm to have th
          appearance of being lop-sided.
          When a girl is ambidextrous she can keep tho
          development of both t-ides equal. And though
          it may be tedious and uninteresting for a good
          player to start all over again by playing villi tbu
          left hand, it is worth all the trouble in the end.
          In golf both hauda are used, and the mighty
          swings not only stretch the musclcn of the arms,
          but the chest and back as well. Add to this tho
          benefit of walking over tho links.
          Horseback riding is a most excellent form of
          exercise, advised by doctors and physical cultu
          rists alike.
          It brings into play all the muscles, Fends the
          blood thundering through the veins aud assured
          ly gives a woman self-confidence, self-control as

          more -to' develop the bust than a year of massaging-
          Your bones will ache and your muscles vnll be
          eore,' but cheer up. Any kind of exercise taken
          when you are uuaccustdmcd to it will produce
          imilar results.
          The benefits of walking arc well known. This,
          the most common form of exercise, is recommend
          ed for fleshy people who wish to part with their
          superfluous flesh, but the lean kind need not
          worry- When walking is not too strenuously a
          plied it is a most excellent all around exercise,
          made doubly beneficial when the practice of cor
          rect breathing becomes a part of your regime.
          Remember that your exercise in the fresh air j
          will have but little value unless you. take deep 'j
          vitalizing breaths', filling your lungs to their ca- !i

          ■pets This is not a vulgar slangism, if you

          Besides the acute annoyance of having cold feet
          this condition indicates that you ore not in good

          Now you arc required to do a funny little stunt-
          Stnrt on a run, but stand just wnere you ore
          lienil you kners far forward, then put left foot
          out in front, then right. Repeat exercise without
          allowing the herl.« to reneh the floor. Hold the
          breath for a second, expel. Continue the motion
          Until you fen] tired, rest, and resume it.
          EXERCISK IV.
          Place both hands over the head, locking the
          thumbs together. Take a deep breath, rsieiug
          your chest hign, and walk about yoxir room on
          tiptoe; hold the breath for a few neconds, eipel,
          take another, hold, expel; and bo walk about the
          apartment until you are quite tired. Be sure to
          keep your arms stretched high above your head.
          When it possible to do thia exercise during
          the day besides morning and night, so much the
          better.
          EXERCISE V.
          Lie on the floor or on a very hard couch; for
          in this exercise there must be no yielding under
          the body. Take a deep inhalation through the
          nose, raising the abdomen as you do so. Then
          still holding the breath, force the chest upwards,
          letting the abdomen down. Repeat movements,
          and exhale through your nose while the chest is
          raised. Practice until capable of doing move
          ments five times without letting your breath out,
          abdomen nnd chest up alternately.
          EXERCISE VI.
          Here ia another good exercise taken recum
          bent position, lie on the floor, take a deep
          breath, raißO the abdomen and feet without bend
          ing tbe knees. When they are nearly perpendic
          ular, bend knees and move limbs as though mov-
          tag Ihe pedals of n bicycle. Be careful to turn
          tile toes up and down an you mnke the revolu

          cising.
          EXERCISK VH.
          Stand erect, take a deep breath. Bend knee of
          right limb and try to touch shoulder with it. D
          thin ten times, breathing, holding breath, and ex
          pelling; then take up exercise with left limb.
          There is considerable work attached to these
          exercises and some may be considered vigorous;
          but they will certainly do the work for you if
          faithfully followed.

          T* I IIERK is no disputing the fact that
          girls need exercise as much as boys,
          and the day has long gone by when
          I a frail, delicate, white-faced girl
          was regarded as being a model of
          femininity.
          Girls are no longer afraid of being strong
          and ruddy They are beginning to thoroughly
          understand that good health is not the pre
          rogative of one sex, and that good health can
          only Be preserved by exercise.
          It is true that all girls cannot exercise as
          they should. Some are so situated that ev
          ery hour from sunrise to sunset has its duties,
          each one confining; others inherit ailments
          that prevent walking or running, and a few
          perhaps are restrained by false ideas oi
          dtcorum from developing their frames by ex
          ercise. But the majority remain in a state
          of ill health simply because they will not ex
          ercise, or do not know how to set about it.
          Perhaps many do not know what exercise
          really is. A carriage ride is not exercise,
          neither is housework nor any exacting labor,
          no matter how hard it may be. II that were
          bo, the blacksmith would be the most long
          lived of men; but statistics prove otherwise.
          Gymnastics are not always exercise in the
          true sense. No pennnncnt good can come of
          ¦winging clubs or dumb bells in a close
          room, unless followed by a brisk walk and
          a bath. Croquet is exercise, and lawn tennis
          is best of all. But. neither •of these games
          is beneficial if played for fashion's sake.
          The girl who gets herself up in a ""stun
          ning"" costume and plays for the effect on
          the spectators, might as well be reading a
          novel in the parlor. Loose clothing, com
          mon sense shoes and an ardent desire to win
          tin 1 game, are the requirements for exercise.
          Mowing is another capita] exercise for girls,
          if they can overcome their natural timidity;
          and swimming is better sitll. It is not gen
          erally known that girls swim more gracefully
          than boys and learn quicker. Both these ex
          ercises have an additional value in the fact
          'that they may some time preserve life.
          Pitching quoits is beneficial exercise, and
          trains the eye and hand. Badminton, a vari
          ation of the old game of battledore and shut
          tle-cock, is a game which forces all the
          muscles of the legs and arms into action,
          nml puts the players into a glow of pleasura
          ble excitement.
          Where good roads abound, cycling is an
          exercise timt is beneficial, if not carried to
          excess. No girl should attempt to ride more
          than twenty miles a day: to ride more is re
          ducing exercise to work. It is injurious to
          try to pee how far or fast you can go in a
          given time. Take it moderately and you will
          ?ever tire of your wheel.
          Lastly comes walking, and I think that is
          the ben( exercise of all. •It is the simplest
          of all exercises, yet there are some rules to
          be observed if you would get the greatest
          bnefit. The best time to walk is before nine
          in the morning or after five in the after
          noon. Begin with a mile walk every morn
          ing or evening and increase the length until
          you can cover ten miles a day?
          Walk in the country if possible; if that is
          impracticable, choose wide streets, those nneci
          with trees preferred. Mind how you walk.
          Square your shoulders, expand your chest,
          and hold your head high. Keep the mouth
          closed when not talking, and breathe through
          the nose. Step out easily and firmly, letting
          the ball of the foot strike the ground first.
          Vary the location of the walk each day if
          possible, and exercise the ere and mind as
          well as the body. Never let the walk become
          a drudgery.
          When you return home take a Rponge bath,
          a vigorous rubbing, a cool gown, a glass of
          milk and a nap. If you do not feel healthy,
          happy and wise after a month of this exer
          cise, you may be sure that yoii have some
          chronic disease.
          In summing up, remember that all exer
          cise, to be beneficial, must be taken in the
          open air. You may amuse yourself over a
          billiard table or a game of cards, or you may
          have a lovely time in a ball room, but you
          cannpt develop your form or add an ounce to
          your weight unless you breathe fresh air.
          The simplest exercise in the open air will do
          you more good than the most elaborate gym
          naßtics""in a closed room.
          You must also bear \p mind that exercise
          must be continuous to be beneficial. Once
          you get yourself in good condition, you must
          keep there by constant exercise.
          Do not look upon this as a task: with in
          creaaing strength the exercise will be a posi
          tive pleasure, which you will not think of
          shirking. You will be proud of your ability,
          arid your ambition will grow with your
          achievements. Try it for one year, and see
          if I am not a true prophet.

          arm muscles. Work with the clubs

          She morning.
          I A simple exercise for the same part
          cf the arm is this: Let the bacys of
          the forearms rest upon the hips, draw
          ing the elbows back so that the arms
          Wich the hips near the wrists^ J 1“
          hands are palms up. In this Poslt1'’""
          clench and open the fists, spreading
          the fingers as you do so.
          To vary the monotony of this mo
          tion. stretch the arms forward h°*‘:
          sontally, palms down. Clench and
          open the fists.
          i For the upper arm. use this motion.
          Raise the arms laterally until the el
          hows are at shoulder level. Let the
          'tips of the fingers rest lightly upon the
          shoulders. Now force the elbows for
          ward and backward as far as you can.
          Drop the arms naturally against the
          aides. Bring up the forearms against
          l the chest until they stand vertically,
          the edges of the palms forward, the
          lingers straight and pointed upward.
          Thrust the arms upward straight above
          the head. To bring them back to the
          ‘original position, force them obliquely
          «back and slowly let them fall to the
          Bides again. Perform this exercise In
          four counts: One, to raise the fore
          arms: two, to thrust upward; three and
          four, to let the arms fall.
          An exercise used by Uncle Sam’s
          Soys In blue is worth everything to
          Jncle Sam's girls, as well, If they
          •ould QU the hollows that lurk about
          undeveloped shoulders. I^et the arms
          fall at the sides. Raise them laterally,
          palms up, and bring them to a grace
          ful circle above the head, ending by let
          ting the finger tips louch the top of the
          head. The difficult part of this exer
          cise Is to bring the backs of the fingers
          against each other, while they meet on
          top of the head, at the same time forc
          ing the elbows back. When you have
          learned to do this, forcing the elbows
          back Into tje same plane as the body,
          then It will be good for you to hold the
          position for several seconds. You will
          feel your chest forced forward under
          the strain. To return, separate the
          hands, turning the finger tips outward,
          and let the arms describe a graceful
          circle to the sides again.
          A very old exercise, one used by
          laborers to keep warm as well as by
          women to round their shoulders, Is
          simply swing the arms back and forth
          outstretched, bringing the palms to
          gether behind you as high as you can
          make them reach.
          A splendid shoulder exercise Is this:
          Raise the arms laterally, palms up.
          until they are at shoulder level. Keep
          ing them outstretched, describe circles
          with them, holding the palms always
          up and never letting the arms pass In
          front of the line of the breast.
          Raise the elbows laterally to shoul
          der level, letting the fingers rest light
          ly upon the chest. Throw the arms
          back until each entire arm Is out
          stretched laterally, palms forward. You
          must force them In such a way that
          you can feel the chest pressed forward.
          Raise the chest at the same time.
          Let the arms fall at the sides. Raise
          them laterally until the elbows are at
          shoulder level, the finger tips resting
          upon the shoulder, then let them fall
          to the sides again. Do this lightly ten
          times, then imagine a heavy weight
          in the hands, and lift it powerfully to
          the shoulder. Go through this ten
          times.
          Stretch the arms forward at should
          er level, palms laid together. Separ
          ate them, turning the palms down
          ward, and move the arms back until
          they are outstretched literally, still at
          shoulder level. Let fall to the sides
          slowly and repeat.
          For the especial development of the
          upper arm. resort to dumbbells. Al
          most all of the elementary dumbbell
          exercises have some effect upon this
          part of the arm. The newer school
          of extension work with dumbbells is
          not devoted to this particular develop
          ment, but the old-/ashioned exercises
          are. for the most part, including? chest
          and shoulder work. Do not use the
          heavy Iron bell, however, as the old
          school often prescribed. A two-pound

          Business women who sit at their
          desks all day and have little oppor
          tunity to exercise have more of a h;p
          problem than women in the home, who
          can get about if they like, play a
          round of golf, walk, exercise. Business
          women should stand as much as they
          can, walk, pick up their own papers
          instead of having the office boy do
          it. There's the danger of having the
          spread attributed to old age instead of
          sedentary work, you know.
          From what I've seen of the Fall i
          silhouette a firm, even but feminine j
          line will be the vogue. Exaggerated
          hips won't be in the running at all.
          There's consolation, though. In the S
          fact that there is still ample time to j
          roll the excess pads away. j
          Summer is so conducive to exerrpe. j
          The casual clothes, the Ioosp slacks, j
          shorts, culottes, make exercise easv. j
          If you are at the beach you can j
          exercise, squat, jump—it's done, and j
          no one thinks anything of it. j
          You can lie right on thp sand, op i
          i'our back for on floor or mati. hate i
          the shoulders touching the floor, mat
          ir sand. Arms out at shoulder level
          at right angles to rest of body. Now
          raise right leg and bring it over, trying
          to touch the tips of the left hand. I
          Repeat a few times and then try it i
          left leg to right hand. I
          The bark roll is one you ran do j
          (good for you If you rani if you want
          to attract an admiring crowd and
          whittle hips down at one and the
          same time. It is a little difficult for
          oeginners. But. with practice cornea
          finesse. Same position on back, j
          shoulders touching floor, arms at sides, I
          palms down. Raise both legs off the i
          floor and draw them back overhead. j
          5ee if you ran touch your toes to the i
          floor back over your head.
          This exercise does wonders for hips,
          strengthens the bark, flattens the
          abdomen.",No timeline found
