            CHINESE EXCLUSION CONVENTION OPENS
            FIGHT IN DEFENSE OF AMERICAN LABOR
            PRESIDENT WILL URGE RE-ENACTMENT OF EXCLUSION LAW.
            D. C, Nov. 21, 1901. Hon. James D. Phelan, San Francisco, Cal.; I have seen the President. I have the best authority for saying that he will not only recom
            mend in his message the re-enactment of the Geary law, but will go further and urge that it be made stronger. J, c. NEEDHAM.
            CHINESE QUESTION ONE OF"" RACE
            TyTy E are the warders of the Golden Gate; we must stand
            y y here forever in the pathway of the Orient, and if there
            is any danger or trial it is for us to sound the alarm.
            I regard the Chinese question as a race question. I regard
            it as an international question; and above and over all, a
            question involving the preservation of our civilisation. The State
            of California, with its sezrn hundred miles of seaboard facing
            the Orient, is entitled to speak on this question for tlie people of
            the United States. Excerpt from Mayor James D. Phelan' s ad
            dress at the Chinese Exclusion Convention.
            Leading Citizens Gather to Urge
            Re-enactment of the
            Geary Law.
            IT was a distinctly representative
            gathering of business, professional
            and laboring men that packed Metro
            politan Temple yesterday afternoon
            when Mayor Phelan called the Chi
            nese Exclusion Convention to order.
            Xearly every seat in the large auditorium
            •was taken, the lower floor being devoted
            to the use of the delegates from all parts
            of California, while the gallery was given
            up to the general public. All present
            seemed to be animated by one impulse,
            that of doing their utmost to secure the
            re-enactment of the Chinese exclusion act
            and thereby prevent the threatened In
            vasion of Mongol horclee to the peril and
            degradation of American labor.
            The gathering was of that character
            which lends weight to any public move
            ment and the conclusions of which are ac
            corded respectful consideration In legisla
            tive halls. The convention was not the
            outgrowth of political or partisan senti
            ment, but of the fear of the people of the
            State that the danger which menaces
            their advancement and prosperity might,
            unless strong measures were taken, be
            actually realized. In order that the peo
            ple of the East might understand how
            the communities on the ""Western confines
            of the continent feel concerning the un
            restricted immigration of Chinese into
            their midst, the convention was decided
            upon, and it is needless to say that the
            memorial which is to be adopted to-day
            will prove to be an unanswerable argu
            ment to those of the East, who, without
            the slightest knowledge of the blight-
            Borne characteristics of the Chinese, have
            df-clared open sympathy for the coolie
            hordes which are only awaiting the ex
            piration of the exclusion act in May next
            SENATOR PERKINS WOULD CO FURTHER.
            /T is our people who pay the taxes that have built up our splendid institutions, and we should
            draw the line furtJter, only this is not the time nor occasion. I would permit no one to come into
            this country unless he felt as he approaches these shores as Moses did when he approached the
            burning bush that he stood upon sacred ground; and the voice coming out of that bush from the
            American people is ""Unless you love freedom, unless you believe in republican institutions, unless you
            believe in the free public schools, you cannot come into this country."" Excerpt from Senator Perkins'
            address before the Chinese Exclusion Convention.

              THE Chinese Exclusion Convention
              completed its labor? yesterday
              after the adoption of one of the
              most important as well as vipor
              ous memorials on the Chinese
              question ever addressed to the
              President and Congress of the United
              Elates. The attitude of the people of Cal
              ifornia and of the entire Pacific Coast to
              ward the problem of unrestricted immi
              gration of Asiatics to these shores as rep
              resented in the convention was distinctly
              outlined, and its language cannot fail to
              he understood in the East as being the
              Fpontaneous outburst of a united people
              n the imposition upon them i f a
              grievous wrong.
              The delegates gathered in force yester
              day morning and listened with enthusi
              asm to many speakers. Only one theme
              was discuss-ei, only one idea advanced,
              namely, unalterable resistance to the pro
              ject of unrestricted Chinese immigration
              to America. Tie danger of a Mongolian
              invasion In the event of the refusal of
              :ess to re-enact the exclusion law
              wae pointed out in forceful language by
              all the speakers. The delegates choc-reel
              heartily at every patriotic sentiment
              voiced by the orators, and particularly
              when the necessity o* protecting Ameri
              can labor against foreign competition was
              urged. The members of the convention
              .6howed by their zeal t^at they were in
              accord with the speakers, whose senti
              ments they cordially indo-f>ed.
              The report of the comir.ittee on perma
              nent organization was tae first matter
              to engage the attention of the delegates
              et the morning session. The recommen
              dation that the temporary officers be
              made permanent was adopted amid
              cheers. It was expected that the memo
              l rial committee would be abl* to file its
              report, but the announcement by Chair
              man Geary that further time was re-
              Quired by the cotimittee resulted in the
              desired action beltg taken. There being
              sm> definite bufiinesi before the convention,
              The San Francisco Call.
              speechmaking was indulged in. Assistant
              Tnii^rj States District Attorney Duncan
              E. McKinlay was introduced by the chair,
              and that gentleman delivered an able ad
              dress in which he reviewed the Chinese
              question from the standpoint of the Dis
              trict Attorney's office. The legal aspects
              of the issue were capably presented, the
              peakcr's remarks at times evoking
              hearty applause. So favorably did he im
              press his hearers that at the close of his
              speech he was honored by a Tote of
              thanks for his brilliant oratorical effort.
              The Rev. Dr. William Rader followed
              with a witty address, in which he re
              viewed the Chinese question from the
              standpoint of morality and religion. His
              allusions to the vices prevailing in San
              Francisco's Chinatown, and of their ef
              fect upon the whole community, were im
              pressively advanced, and his remark that
              the proper place in which to Christianize
              the Chinese was in China and not in this
              country, evoked cheers. The address
              was replete with statistical information,
              and it was listened to with profound in
              terest by all present.

              The Yellow Peril.
              It will be necessary for the present congress
              to. take acjtion upon the Chinese exclusion act
              which expires by limitation May 24, 1902. The
              Kjansas City platform contained the following
              plank on the subject:
              We favor the continuance and strict en-
              forcement of the Chinese exclusion law and
              its application to the samo classes of all
              'Asiatic races.
              This plank was unanimously agreed upon by
              the platform committee, and there was no dissent
              from it among the delegates. It is to be expected,
              therefore, that the proposition to extend the
              Chinese exclusion act will receive the support of
              all the democrats in the house and senate. The
              editor of The Commoner received a letter a few
              days ago from a democrat who complained that
              the laboring men of the Pacific slope had ignored
              the. Chinese question in the last campaign and
              suggested that it would only be a merited punish
              ment if the republican party refused to extend the
              exclusion act. It is not unnatural that some
              resentment should be felt toward those who sup
              ported the republican party in spite of the dangers
              which republican supremacy involves, and yet no
              one can justify himself in either supporting a bad
              policy or in failing to protest against it merely be
              cause the policy would punish .some who ought to
              have exerted themselves to prevent ij:. That
              many of the republican leaders are in favor of a
              ..policy, Jfcat will flood the country with cheap
              Chinese labor, is true, and that an imperial policy
              tends to lend encouragement to the cheap labor
              proposition, is also true, but the failure of the
              laboring men' to see these dangers in advance
              would not justify .democrats in remaining quiet
              on this subject, although the republicans are in
              ""power and are responsible for legislation.
              The Chinese question is one that effects the en
              tire country, not the Pacific Coast alone or the
              laboring men alone. It is true that the Pacific
              Coast would feel the evil effects of Chinese emigra
              tion first, and it is also true that the laboring men
              would come into immediate contact with oriental
              labor, but in its ultimate influence the subject
              touches all parts of the country and reaches all
              classes. The question is whether we are going to
              build up a strong, independent, upright and pa
              triotic people and develop a civilization that will
              exert a helpful influence on all the world, or
              whether we are going to be a greedy, grasping na
              tion, forgetful of high ideals and concerned only
              in the making of money.
              Chinese emigration is defended by two classes
              of people. First, by those, comparatively few in'
              number, who believe that universal brotherhood
              requires us to welcome to our shores all people of
              all lands. This is the sentimental argument ad
              vanced in favor of Chinese emigration. There Is
              no more reason why we should construe brother
              hood to require the admission of all people to our
              country than there is that we should construe
              brotherhood to require the dissolution of family
              ties. The family is a unit; it is the place where
              character and virtue and usefulness are developed,
              and from the family a good or evil influence ema
              nates. It is not necessary nor even wise that the
              family environment should be broken up or that
              ill who desire entrance should bet admitted to the
              family oircle. In a larger sense a nation is a
              family. It is the center for the cultivation of na
              tional character, national virtue and national use
              fulness. A nation is under no obligation to the
              outside world to admit any body or anything that
              would injuriously effect the national family; in
              fact it Is under obligation to itself not to do so.
              The influence of the United States will bo much
              more potent for good if we Temaln a homogeneous
              nation with all citizens in full sympathy with all
              other citizens. No distinct race like tho Chinese
              can come into this country without exciting a fric
              tion and a race prejudlco which will mako it moro
              difficult for us to exercise a wholesome influence
              upon the Chinese in China, not to speak of our in
              fluence on other nations.
              Let us educate tho Chinese who desire to learn
              of American institutions; let us offer courtesy and
              protection to those who come here to travel' and
              investigate, but it will not be of permanent benefit
              to either the Chinese or to us to Invite them to be
              come citizens or to permit them to labor here and
              carry the proceeds of their toil back to their own
              country.
              The second, and by far the larger class, em
              braces those who advocate Chinese emigration on
              the ground that it will furnish cheap labor for
              household- and factory work. There is no force In
              the argument that is made by some that it is diffi
              cult to secure girls to do housework. If domestic
              service is not popular as compared with other
              w.ork, it is because the pay is not sufficient to mako
              it attractive and the remedy lies in better wages.
              Labor can be secured for any and every honorable
              -position-when-the'i'4sufflcienfc-to'attratitr'
              and the demand for Chinese servants comes with
              poor grace from those who often spend on a sin
              gle social entertainment as much as a servant'3
              wages would amount to in an entire year. At this
              time When skilled and intelligent American labor
              is able to compete in foreign markets with the
              cheapest, labor of the world, it is absurd to talk
              about the necessity for cheap factory hands.
              The increase in Japanese Immigration, or rath
              er importation (for large numbers of them are
              brought for specific purposes) has been referredto
              in a former issue of The Commoner. IWwas there
              suggested that the Japanese government would
              doubtless, if asked to do so, place restrictions upon
              Japanese emigration that would make it unneces
              sary for us to deal with the subject by legislation.
              This matter should at once be brought to tho at
              tention of the Japanese authorities, and unles3
              sufficient and satisfactory action Is taken by the
              home government the Chinese exclusion act should
              be made broad enough to extend to Japanese of
              the same class.
              The subject of oriental emigration cannot be
              discussed without giving some consideration to
              the danger of cheap labor from the Philippine isl
              ands. It will soon be necessary to legislate on
              this subject. If the Filipinos are permitted to
              come here there is danger that the Philippine ques
              tion will become only second in aggravation lo
              the Chinese question. If, on the other hand, the
              Filipinos are prohibited from coming here (if a
              republic can prohibit the inhabitants of one part
              from visiting another part of the republic), will it
              not excite a just protest on the part of the Fili
              pinos? How can we excuse ourselves if we In
              sist upon opening the Philippine islands to the In
              vasion of American capital, American speculators,
              and American task-masters, and yet close our doors
              to those Filipinos who, driven from home, may
              seek an asylum here?
              TIio democratic party should take a strong
              and aggresslvo position on this question. It can
              afford to'oppoBO Chinese emigration and insist
              upon tho unity and homogoncousness of ""oiir
              nation. It can afford to Insist that Japanese la
              borers shall be treated the samo as Chinese labor
              ers and excluded, by agreement with tho Japanese
              government if possible, by congressional legisla
              tion if necessary.
              The democratic leaders should further point
              out that the Philippine question involves tho samo
              menace to our country, and that as wo can neither
              afford to admit tho Filipinos nor yet mako a dis
              tinction between different parts of tho republic,
              we should at once declare our purposo to give the
              Filipinos independence as soon as a stable govern
              ment can be established.

              THE CHINESE
              EXCLUSION ACT.
              One of the big questions which is
              agitating thit country at tho present
              time is the Chinese exclusion act, and
              the effect its rigid enforcement has
              now and may have in the future, on
              American commerce and trade in
              China. The exportation of cotton and
              cotton goods to China has grov-n from
              almost nothing to $40,000,000 in a few
              yca-s. Other lines of exports to the
              celestial kingdom have shown very
              large gams. The American manufac
              turer is clamoring tor an open door
              to the trade of China. The American
              manufacturer has always been solf-
              ifsh and in most instances, been ready
              to sacrifice the good of the people to
              his own profit and selfish ends. It
              matters little to the manufacturer of
              cotton goods in New England or the
              south if the Pacific coast and adja
              cent territory is overrun with cheap
              Chinese coolies, the lowest strata of
              Chinese life. 5f he can find a ready
              and a profitable market for a few
              more millions of dollars of cotton
              goods and other products of his shops.
              7""he cry for more liberal immigration
              Jiws for the Chinese comes wholly
              Irom the manufacturers. Tne people
              of the Pacific coast don't want the
              aan at any price. He is a men-
              ace to this country and his very pres
              ence exerts a contaminating in
              fluence. It is impossible for him to
              amalgamate with the people of this
              country. He can not become a citizen
              and ho has no desire to make this
              land of the free his home and reside
              here permanently. Personally he Is
              as objectionable as tho negro of the
              J south and if we must have cheap labor
              1 let us give the negro a chance. ""We
              lave him with us and while he is not
              .as skillful as the Chinaman or as In
              dustrious, he Is by far the best cheap
              laborer in the world.
              The Chinese exclusion act has been
              in operation for more than twenty
              years. At tho time of its passage a
              perfect horde of orientals were
              streaming Into this country, over
              running the Pacific coast states, and
              drifting far back into the interior. The
              exclusion act stopped this unholy in
              vasion at once and the flow of China
              men began to go the other way. There
              were at that time more than a quar
              ter of a million Chinamen In the
              ""United States. During these twenty
              years this number has been on the
              gradual decline. Death has thinned
              tho ranks of the yellow skinned sons
              of the east and a large proportion of
              the Chinamen who were in this coun
              try have made their ""stake"" and re
              turned to China to remain. In San
              Francisco. Los Angeles, Portland and
              Seattle the gradual decrease in the
              number of Chinese has been most
              notable. It is doubtful if at the pros
              sent time there are 50,000 Chinese in
              the entire country, and the country
              will be infinitely better off when
              these, too, ""have folded their tents,
              like the Arab, and silently stolen
              away.""
              The manufacturers, for years, have
              kept an outrageous tariff on all
              classes of manufactured goods by
              their cry of ""protection to American
              labor,"" and they have filtched mill
              ions of dollars from the pockets of
              the people under the guise of a tariff
              to enrich their own. It matters not
              to them how heavy the burden on
              the shoulders of the people, just so
              they get their pound of flesh. Now
              they wo ild throw wide open the doors
              to the Chinese in order to get a few
              more dollars of trade.

              States circuit court of appeals in this
              city, the court holding that the act of
              .April 7, 1904, continued the exclusion
              act in full force, congress haying full
              potyer to dp so.
              Hong Wing is one of six Chinamen
              who had been ordered deported under
              the provisions of the Chinese exclu
              sion act and the cases being identical
              the one decision will apply to all six.
              Attorneys for the applicant main
              tained that the exclusion act was void
              and that their clients eould not be de
              ported.
              The decision was announced by
              Judge Richards, who said that the
              main point presented to the court was
              whether the act of April 7, 1904, con
              tinued the Chinese exclusion act in
              force and the court was satisfied that
              it did do so without reference to any
              existing treaties or regulations. The
              act was passed in view of the treaty
              expiring and it had continued the pro
              visions of the treaty. Congress has
              the power to modify, reject or concur
              in treaties and it had done what was
              wholly within its power in passing this
              act. The decision of the lower court
              was, therefore, sustained and the ap
              peal dismissed. '-..hffam

              The meeting at Assembly hall last night
              to discuss the 'Cbloese question was well
              attended by workingmen of Helena, J, E.
              Boncher presided and J. Y. Bennett was
              secretary, Chairman Boucher stated that
              all were no doubt aware that the Chinese
              exclusion act expired in May, and that a
              measure would be introduced in congress
              to continue the restriction. ""It is a matter
              of interest to us and to the business men of
              Helena,"" bhe said. ""I am surprised that
              there are not more basiness men present,
              But because there are eot more of them is
              no reason why we should not express our
              opinions.""
              L i. Glidea said the meeting had been
              called by him to take action on the peti
              tions to congress for the exclusion of the
              Chinese, and for the election of senators by
              the direct vote of the people, both of which
              were suggeted by T. V. Powderly. The seo
              retary stated that he had petitions on the
              Chinese question prepared for the signa
              tures of those present and for other work
              ingmen's organizations. It was decided to
              allow five minutes to each man to talk on
              the subject. As this was announced one mani
              present began a rambling speech about the
              uselessness of the Chinese to the mer
              chants, the doctors and the real estate men,
              and was proceeding to state that China had
              44,000,000 people and the United States but
              17,000,000, when the bhairman called him
              down with the remark that this was a
              meeting to discuss a serious problem, and
              not a ""josh."" The culprit took his seat,
              and, the discussion was taken up in a seri
              ons strdin.
              John Finn suggested that the working
              men would have to come out and let it be
              known to the politicians that whoever was
              not on their side could not get thir votes.
              F. A. Adrian said they could nothing un
              less they all stood together and refused to
              patronize the Chinamen or those who em
              ployed them.
              Adolf Halest thought the question a grave
              one, not only because the Chinaman worked
              for less than a white person, but because
              what money these people got was with
              drawn from the already inadequate circulr
              tion and taken back to their native land.
              Besides that there were the vices the Chi
              nrmen brought here, such as the opium
              habit. While it was impossible to get rid
              of all the Chinamen now here, it would be
              well to keep others from comine. Those
              now here would soon die out. He said the
              working people had to patronize the Chi
              namen for their garden truck because no
              white man raised any, but that would not
              be enough to keep them here.
              Chairman Boncher said the solution of
              the problem was a difficult one. It might
              do to take the almost unprecedented step
              of sending all the Chinamen back, but as
              that was well nigh impossible, the next
              great question was how to mitigate the
              evil and reduce it to the minimum. The
              exclusion -act did nrot remedy the disease.
              it was not heroic enough. It was wonder
              ful how, when congress passed a law, it was
              so easy to evade it. The people of the
              United States were most considerate of
              evil doers. It would seem that when any
              great wrong was committed it was neces
              sary for a certain class of people to get out
              and roar, and all the others called them
              agitators. Perhaps Dennis Kearney was an
              agitator, but he had a kick. No attention
              was paid to him, but when the trouble be
              gan to effect the upper classes, then congress
              took action. There were certain stores on
              Broadway occupied by Chinamen as mer
              chants. If the Chinman ever vacated the
              places the stores could never be rented to a
              white man for the same sum. That had
              been found out in Portland and San Fran
              oisco. But the Helena business men knew
              it all; they would not learn by experience.
              When the merchants began to feel the effect
              of the presence of the Chinese then the
              legislators would act. He feared they never
              would act on the appeal of the workingmen.
              ""I he only way I see is to pass an exclusion
              not that will last forever."" he continued.
              ""We must say to our legislators that this is
              the one thing we insist upon. The Knights
              of Labor have a clause in. their declaration
              of principles that no creed or color shall be
              prohibited from being members. The same
              is found in the constitution of the United
              Statee. Yet Jefferson and the other fram
              ers of the constitution never meant a lot of
              vampires and bloodsuckers should be ad
              mnitted who come because we have some
              thing they want, aeni who, when they get
              it, go back home to enjoy it. Our only way
              is to impress on the minds of the people
              who are in office and those who want to get
              there, that their present and further safety
              depends on the passage of an exclusion act
              that will last forever.""
              When the petition to congress was being
              passed around for signatures Mr. Gildea
              suggested taking up the senatorial question,
              but Michael Corbett thought that it would
              be bad policy to drop the Chinese matter at
              this point. He favored continuing to hold
              the meetines, but in a larger place. He
              also suggested withdrawing all patronage
              from the Chinamen. The quickest way to
              get rid of them is to lot them alone, Mr.
              Gildea said the Chinese question had been
              effectually disposed of so far as the present
              meeting was concerned. The question of
              electing senators by direct vote of the peo
              ple was eof as great, if not greater import
              ance than the Chinese question. The
              Chinese exclusion noact had been in force ten
              years, but it was a prohibition that did not
              prohibit. The other question was one of
              bringing the senato s closer to the people,
              where they conld,bo dealt with better and dic
              tated to in stronger terms than they could
              be now. Chairman Bouocher wanted
              another and a larger meeting with the
              business men present. liecretary Bennett
              did not have much faith in the business
              men attending. ""As an example of their
              duplicity, or policy,"" he said, ""you will re
              member that the council unanimously
              passed anti-Chinese resolutions. Four of
              ths men who voted for them employ China
              men in their houses. One told me it was
              because better service could be had from
              the Chinamen. The other said he would
              talk about it when the Burlingame treaty
              was rescinded."" Mr. Gildea then moved to
              take up the senatorial question.

                Eiffel tower is by far the highest structure in
                the world. It presents a decidedly unique ap
                pearance, too in general outline not unlike a
                stack of four gigantic muskets with their
                butts well and solidly spread and their bay
                onets joining at their tips.
                The Eiffel tower stands in the Champ de
                Mars, almost on the left bank of the river
                Seine, just in the rear of the Quai d'Orsay,
                and in fact a part of its foundation is sunk
                through an old arm of the river, which lias
                been filled in these many years. Its base
                covers a plot of ground 328 feet square, or
                nearly two and a half acres in extent.
                GUSTAVF. EIFFEL.
                It Ls really at the base a group of four tow
                ers, each nearly fifty feet square, placed at
                the corners of the plot of ground, and in
                clining toward each other as they rise at an
                angle of fifty-four degrees. Each tower con
                sists of four columns, bound together by
                trusswork, and each column rests on a
                masonry pier which is so built that the weight
                of the column rests upon it squarely and not
                at an ancle.
                As the tower is 0S4 feet high. it will be
                seen that the matter of providing a solid
                foundation was one of great importance.
                There was a lot of boring and digging befon
                the spot upon which the tower stands was
                finally selected.
                The foundation rests upon a thick stratum
                of sand and gravel. It may be well to say.
                for the benefit of those who think sand is a
                rather treacherous sort f ground, that a bed
                of sand and gravel, away under ground, is
                pretty solid stuff. One of the towers of the
                Brooklyn Bridge rests on that sort of base.
                The foundations of the two piers of the Eiffel
                tower farthest from the Seine rest on sand
                and gravel about twenty-five feet below the
                surface of the ground. These foundations
                were laid in open excavations, and consist
                first of great solid platforms of beton, six
                feet thick, and next of four stone piers which
                rise to the surface to receive the iron col
                umns. The foundations for the two piers nearest
                the river were not so easily laid. It was
                necessary to go thirty-five feet below the
                surface of the ground, end this was sixteen
                feet under water. So caissons had to be
                used, as they were in building the Brooklyn
                Bridge piers.
                A caisson is in effect simply an enormous
                iron box, without any cover, turned upside
                down. The method of using it is to dig the
                earth out from under it and allow it to
                gradually settle as the excavation pro
                gresses, meanwhile building the pier on top.
                When the required depth is reached the cais
                a .n itself is filled up with the beton, and it
                forms the bottom layer of it a foundation.
                A shaft is left running through the pier
                auove for entrance and exit as the work goes
                on, and the air in the caisson and shaft is
                compressed to whatever is necessary to keep
                the water out of the bottom. It is the prin
                ciple of the diving bell modified.
                Work on the foundations was begun on
                January 28, 1887, and at the end of June they
                were completed. Then began the labor of
                setting up the innumerable pieces of iron of
                which the tower is composed, and it went on
                at a vapid rate, for each individual piece
                came from the works of M. Eiffel, at Leval-lois-Pere
                cut to its exact dimensions, fitted
                and drilled, so that no modification was neces
                sary at the place of operations. Up to a
                height of about fifty feet the workmen re
                quired no scaffolding to work upon, as each
                pier supported itself, although each leaned
                toward the others. Then an artificial support
                had to le provided, as above that height, un
                til the first platform was reached, the center
                of gravity of each pier would fall outside of
                the base."

                acres.
                The gardens of the Hotel des Invalided
                contain the exhibitions of tho French
                colonies, of tho several ministers and of
                social economy. At the Quai d'Orny aro
                tho halls of agriculture, viticulture, INhorios
                and general food products. The Trocudoro
                gardens are given up to fruits and flowers
                in tho open air and in glass houses. Tho
                principal buildings aro clustered on the
                Champs de Mars, where a century ago, somo
                of tho great oponing scenes of the revolution
                wero ouacted.
                At tho ontranco, spanning the gateway
                witu the vast archways of Ite base, rises tho
                gigantic Eiffel tower, 'MO metres high. Pass
                ing underneath it tho Central gardou is
                i cached. This has a monumental fountain
                BASE OF EIFFEL TOWER,
                ia tho middlo, and is surrounded by build
                ings containing exhibitions of flue arts,
                boUos lettres, tho liberal arts, and various
                departments of industry.
                Those buildings stand on parallel lines and
                ore crossed in their axis by a high gallery
                manaounted by a doma which leads to th

                ings in tho Champs do Mars, exclusivo of tho
                Mffel tower, has been about (4,000,000, and
                it is intended that they shall remain as per
                aaaent structures. The total outlay author

                The earthworks required a removal of
                700,000 cubic foot. Tke drains and water
                pipes of the Camps do Mars were lengthened
                hf about two miles, and more than 40,009
                ems of iron and steel wero u&ed by the
                holders. The hall of machinery is 1,309 feet
                long and 150 feet high, covered with a roof
                f iron, wood and glass, having a span of
                380 feet in tho clear, the greatest ever at
                tempted. A gullory extends around tke in
                terior for the display of tho lighter classes of
                machinery and from end to end run four un
                ferofcen linos of shafting for distributing the
                Beotivo power. Tho powor is dorived from a
                proup of steam engines placed in one of
                the touts, tho bollors of which transform
                into steam forty tons of wator per hour.
                The total energy is about 400 horse power.
                TJio chief architectural feature of the ex
                position is, of course, tho Eiffel tower, as
                wore the Crystal Palace at London In 1851,
                the iron lighthouse at Paris in 1807, tho groat

                structure eyer rahedjjy Iman, being about
                064 feet high. The Washington monumont
                now stands second, 55.5 feet. The Cologno
                cathedral is 501 feot. Tho tower of Babol
                was probably CS0 high. Moro than 7,000
                tons of metal were us?d in building tho

                28, 1887, and the whole work was completed

                Already the air is' filled with rumors
                respecting the exposition of 1900, says
                a Paris letter in the Philadelphia Tel
                graph. Already are the moans of the
                Parisians rending the air beforehand,
                for it is a Parisian peculiarity to detest
                world's fairs in general, and those held
                in their own city in particular. Quoth
                a miserable native in heartrending ac
                cents: ""Whenever there is a great ex
                hibition all our taxes go up-rtempo-rarily
                we are told, but never by an ac
                cident do they go down. I paid three
                hundred and eighty francs in '77,
                and for the same premises my taxes
                are now three thousand and odd. We
                are overrun by tourists; we are crowd
                ed out of all the theaters; the cabmen
                all go on strike; the cafes all put up
                their prices. For several years before
                all the streets one wants to go through
                are closed to the public because the ex
                hibition is being prepared, and for at
                least a year after the same streets are
                closed because the exhibition is being
                demolished. All your country cousins
                come to town and expect to stay with
                you in an apartment you have always
                found too cramped for the require
                ments of yonr own family; and if I am
                not lucky enough to be dead I shall
                certainly move away before this large
                misfortune falls upon this unhappy
                place.""
                tj Happily all Paris is not so pessi
                mistic as my friend, and the architects
                are busy with their plans. All the
                ground comprised in the exhibition of
                '89 is to be included, as well as the por
                tion of Cour la Heine that will inclose
                the Palais 1' Industrie and its surround
                ing gardens. We are to have an addi
                tional bridge across the Seine which
                will open a vista from the Place de la
                Concorde straight through to the palace
                of electricity, which is to be the cen
                tral feature. Our rulers are greatly
                bored about the Eiffel tower; but as
                the concession was granted for twenty
                years it has got to stand; but the arch
                itects say consolingly that the 7 will
                try and hide it as much as possible.
                The sight of it vexes poetio souls,
                and Francois Coppee, the author, who
                is, by way of being, sthetio, wrote
                a formal protest to the government at
                the time of its erection to request that
                the plan should not be carried out on
                the ground that the Eiffel tower, being
                ugly and ungainly, and furthermore
                being visible from his windows, inter
                fered with his flow of inspiration.
                However, the tower was built never
                theless, and, although we are deadly
                tired of seeing it about, Coppee con
                tinues to write, so evidently his flow
                ol inspiration was only impeded and
                not permanently plugged up. Further
                more, we are to have a branch exhibit
                at Versailles, which will rouse that
                sleepy little town from its chief ou
                pation of listening to the grass grow
                ing in the streets. In the splendid
                park of Versailles, on either side of
                the grand canal, is to be the retro
                spective history of gardens throughout
                the ages.
                The Hanging Gardens of Babylon,
                that were counted among the wonders
                of the world, are to be reproduced in
                miniature; Japanese gardens, Persian
                gardens, the Italian garden of the
                renaissance and French and English
                gardens of different epochs. The
                Grand canal itself is to be used for the
                exhibition of one of the floating gar
                dens cultivated by the Aztecs in Mex
                ico before the Spanish conquest of the
                country. The center of the canal is to
                be occupied by a large island built on
                piles, with bridges connecting it with
                the two shores, which is to have
                aquaria, grottoes and cascades, with
                cages for aquatic birds, and the great
                sheet of water is to be additionally or
                namented, by an exact reproduction of
                the little fleet of elegant boats that
                Louis XIV. launched on its surface
                when Versailles was first built All
                this sounds most imposing; but we are
                devoutly thankful that the time for it
                has not yet come. It is like the 6tory
                of the philosopher who was to teach
                the king's donkey to speak in a year's
                time, on pain of death, and never
                bothered about the penalty on the
                crowd tMt the kin? mLrht UJ
                the ""doSkey ""might' die, or ha

                Bach Will Be the Appearance of the
                Eiffel Tower of Parts When
                Painted.
                The Eiffel tower, say the gentlemen
                of esthetic temperament, must go.
                The Eiffel tower, say the gentlemen
                who know the law, must stay for some
                years yet. The Eiffel tower, say the
                esthetes. Is ugly, discouraging to the
                eye and an all-round nightmare. ""Scaf
                fold I cries the carper. ""Down with it
                It has no place in esthetic Paris,""
                ""Impossible! objects the law. ""When
                the company took a lease of it they
                got it for a term of 20 years.. You
                can't break the lease, and the time is
                nowhere up.
                ""But, urges the esthete, ""look at
                the shape, look at the size, look at the
                color! Is not the whole thing hideous""?
                If we can't destroy it we can at least
                improve it and lessen the offense to
                our senses.""
                And so the Eiffel tower is going to be
                metamorphosed. It has. been in color
                a reddish brown, and it is the color to
                which the gentlemen with the fine ideas
                have long objected. They have called
                the tower a shameless creation and re
                peatedly ridiculed the commonplace
                tone of hue. And now they have pre
                v ailed, and the lower is going to be a
                thing of beauty, so far as that goes.
                Silver white is the color agreed upon,
                and it is urged that when the army of
                workmen have finished their painting
                the huge structure will look really not
                so bad after all. Ilalf a hundred men
                will be employed on the building, work
                ing hard every day for two months.
                And 50,000 kilogrammes of paint will
                be used up before the Eiffel tower has
                finally lost its brickdust coat and finds
                itself arrayed in the poetic covering
                which the esthetes have advised. Two
                coats of paint will be applied and the
                brushes will be busy.
                It has been objected that the tbwer
                has always had the appearance or hav
                ing been cast up in inartistic form by
                a careless earth. The tower has seemed
                to rise awkwardly from the ground,
                the critical have said. Why not give
                it such an arrangement as would sug
                gest the idea of dropping from the
                clouds? That would be a pleasing fan
                cy, and if the huge tower were lighted
                at regular intervals it would present a
                picture as of a brilliant creature of the
                clouds, and all the world would be lost
                in admiration. These plans were sug
                gested when the exposition of 1900 were
                tinder discussion, and they have been
                adopted. A ladder from the clouds.
                That was tbe idea. 'And with that the
                esthetic taste, was forced to be sat
                isfied.
                The Eiffel tower has long been the
                universal bed lamp of Paris. The great
                candle in the top would be sadly miss-d,
                even by those who have fought agair.&t

                The authorities of Paris have so decreed.
                This iron spire, the tallest structure in the
                world, and the engineering feat of the last cen
                tury, \.i regarded as a dangerous plaything.
                When a high wind blows from the south the great
                ribbed structure trembles like a frightened horse.
                But let a stiff breeze come bowling down from the
                north and the tower vibrates until the china rattles in
                the cafes, and to those in the observatory at the apex the
                sensation is that of a ship fossed by heavy seas.
                The fact that the tower is more'sensitive to a wind
                from the north than from the south is regarded as proof
                of the structural weakness, and from this springs the
                theory of danger of collapse.
                It is almost twenty years since Gustav Eiffel began
                the work of building his sky-scraper. The mark of com
                pletion was set for 1889, Exposition year, and on March 31
                of that year the tower was thrown open to the public. It
                wa« the leading attraction of the big show, and it has
                not since ceased to attract attention and coin.
                The cost of building the structure was more than
                $1,000,000. Of that amount the French government appro
                priated $29L',000. Eiffel supplied the remainder, trusting
                for his reimbursement to the receipts from admission fees
                and other sources.
                In this he was not uisappolnted, as the profits of the
                first year were almost sufficient to make him whole.
                The lease held by Eiffel will expire in next March, and
                then, if the present plans of the city fathers are realized,
                the work of razing the unique structure will be started.
                The plan is to sell the tower to the highest bidder, the
                purchaser to be given a certain time in which to remove
                what Paris regards as almost a public menace.
                Except as a curio and an Investment for its builder,
                the tower has been somewhat of a failure.
                Much was expected in the scientific world from the
                metaphorical observatory, with its physical and biological
                laboratories, all 954 feet above ground. But little has
                come of this, the enterprise having taken on a rather
                commercial aspect.
                The Eiffel Tower will ever be considered a colossa*

                PARIS, May A, 1907.
                A painter has Just fallen from the Eiffel
                Tower. Four more men must fall to make
                the awful average of the most dangerous
                painting Job in the world?repeated every
                six years only.
                They are repainting the Eiffel Tower,
                and all Paris is concerned about the color,
                on which depends whether the gigantic
                mass of iron shall be the eyesore or the
                glory of the capital.
                Its first shade was ""dead leaf,"" In 1889.
                When the sun lit it up to hazy golden with
                an unreal effect of Jeweler's fragility, even
                the artists who now corse it admitted that
                the Eiffel Tower had its nobility.
                In 1896, after immense discussion, they
                repainted It orange, magnetic currents
                even more than light and weather having
                turned it to a dingy chocolate, heavy and
                obtrusive. In strong sun the orange
                showed gleaming copper or red gold. Oscar
                Wilde declared It magnificent. Puvis de
                Chavannes threatened to blow It up with
                dynamite. From this period dated the bad
                name the tower acquired as a colossal
                piece of engineering vulgarity, usurping
                the artistic note of Paris.
                Then, for the exposition, they painted it
                ""sun color."" In bright lights the tower
                became a thing of glory once again.
                ""All Depends Upon the Faint.""
                ""All depends upon the paint!"" declares
                the city's architect, Bouyard, ""a fact
                which shows the utter inartistic character
                of the Titan 1^3 intruder. The pyramids ol
                Egypt were originally cased with gleaming
                marble; but its present lack does not
                detract from the artistic appropriateness
                of the pyramids to their situation!""
                The tower gleamed sun color seven years
                agoi But the atmospheric electricity received
                every hour since then by such an
                unprecedented mass of iron reaching into
                the air so high is Incalculable. Conducting
                tubes a foot and a half in diameter
                lead it down the four niles to flftv feet be
                low the water-bearing stratum; but the
                effect on the paint la there for every one
                to see. It does not crack the paint off.
                The paint simply disappears, leaving the
                ugly chocolate, the dingy brown of the
                oxidising iron.
                It Is the tower's way of ""calling for new
                victims. Fifty painters, working continuously
                together, take three months to do a
                ingle coat Few tourists realise- the immense
                proportions of the tower, but
                Parisian!, by experience, show you a peculiar
                phenomenon of Its deceptive symmetry.
                They take you In a cab close to the
                tower. It looks heavy and chunky. It
                seems sinking into the earth from lU
                weight. Half a mile distant from that
                oab the tower grows higher and slenderer.
                It seems to lift Itself from the earth, like
                a person rising from his knees. ""Why, It's
                bigger than before!"" you say. At a mil*

                In a country town thirty miles from

                Some Comparisons.
                Tou think Niagara Falls are high? They
                are 105 feet, and St. Paul's Cathedral, Lon- 1
                don. is 404 feet. Niagara Falls could de
                scend from below St. Paul's dome. Now
                place St. Paul's beside the Eiffel tower. It
                reaches only to the second platform of the
                tower?the real beginning of its slender
                shaftl
                Place the Eiffel tower beside the greatest
                buildings of the world. The great pyramid
                does not reach to Its Intermediate platform.
                Neither does the spire of the Cologne 1
                Cathedral.
                Only one 'set of buildings, nevertheless,
                are higher than the Cologne Cathedral
                Bplre. They are the sky-scrapers of American
                dtles, the tallest actually existing being,
                say, 6S6 feet high. It would not reach to
                the tower's intermediate platform, either.
                The loftiest masonry construction In the
                world is to be the Singer building extension,
                at the corner of Liberty street and
                Broadway, New Torlc. Beating any other J i
                American sky-scraper by 57 feet, it will i
                stick 612 feet into the air. And yet even j
                It will not reach to the Eiffel tower's inter- i
                mediate platform 1
                You can easily detect this intermediate i
                platform half way up the slender shaft of 3
                the Eiffel tower. In the nearer photographs j
                It shows for what it is?a mere platform
                for styftlng passengers from one set of ele- t
                vators to another, built In the center of the 1
                the time you git left. This yere man. Bob

          ""Just seo here,"" said Dr. Southwick,
          jumping up and .seating himself, in an arm
          chair. ""Tho condemned man cansifc natur
          ally in a chair like this, placo his liands on
          the metal arms and converse with those
          around him. Tho metal plates would ba
          connected with a powerful d3namo and at
          tho proper moment somebody in another
          room would press a button, closo tho current
          and tho fatal shock would pass through tho
          body of the subject. Tho chargo would go
          straight through tho heart and lungs and
          penetrate the system, death instantly result
          ing. Tho expense of the apparatus with which
          to execute by electricity ia this city would
          bo about $150. Connection cculd bo made
          with the electric light station, and tho ex
          pense of an execution thereafter would bo of
          littlo consequence. It would not cost any
          more than a cigar to kill a condemned man
          after that. It would not bo necessary to
          maintain extensive and powerful machinery
          in nil tho prisons, anil it would bo vastly
          cheaper than hanging.""
          ""You believe then in electricity?'

          minutes afteV the drop fell. If that is in

          of executing criminals''
          ""Prussic acid has been raggested, but
          neither that nor garroting has met with any
          favor. A few havo advocated tho guillotine,
          but I thin!; it is a barbarous mode of causing
          death. Hardly any one favors hanging in
          preference to electricity,
          ""I am heartily in favor of the application
          of electricity for tho purposes in question,
          for the reason that it is simple, sure and
          painless. 1 think that if the places of execu
          tion wero limited to two in this state, say
          ono at Auburn and ono at Sing Sing, the
          two stato prisons, and that all convicts as
          Foon as condemned to suffer tho death
          penalty should bo confined in ono of those
          two prisons (depending somewhat upon the
          locality of tho trial), it would be a vast im
          provement upon tho present method of hav
          ing tho criminal confined in the county jail
          till the daj- of execution.""
          Regarding tho machinery to Iw used
          Senator llcl.lillan says: ""Theso 'executions
          could take place in tho jail proper, in a room
          set apart for that purpose, with no appli
          ances save that of a chair, with tuo nana
          rest of each arm properly connected with
          an electric machine, in which tho condemned
          might bo seated and tho connection made by
          strapping a hand to the hand rest on each
          chair. There can bo no difficulty whatever
          in procuring a current of electricity of suffi
          cient strength to paralyze tho muscles of
          tho heart by this method. Indeed, tho cur
          rent that is used in this city for electric
          lighting purposes is of sufficient strength to
          absolutely dismember the body of nay human
          being, but a current of electricity of suffi
          cient strength to cause instantaneous death
          by passing from hand to hand through the

          After Jan. 1, 1880, murderers in New York
          sate will depart this life on a streak of light
          ing. Any man who has been sentenced to
          death will go off. so quick that he won't

          putting murderers to death by electricity has
          been agitated in the Empire state for more
          than a year.
          After mature deliberation it was concluded
          that hanging would have to go.
          Hanging has been the fashionable mode of
          punishment for centuries, but a commission
          *appointed by Governor Hill concluded that it
          was too harrowing. They made a number
          of experiments, and finally decided upon
          electricity. A bill was passed by the legis
          lature, but-no provision was made as to the
          way the fluid was to be applied. Finally the
          Medico-legal society took the matter Uo, ap
          pointed a commission, and the result was
          that a particular form of applying the elec
          tricity was suggested. This way of killing
          off the refuse population will probably be
          used in New York state hereafter. Three
          ways of applying the fatal electricity were
          proposed, but none of them answered the
          purpose. One was passing the electri.
          iots city from wrist to

          to foot.
          c c m The objections to
          A CURRENT IN THE BRAIn these methods were
          that the prisoner might have convulsions.
          It was desired, of course, to take the utmost
          care of the prisoner. He was to die as pleas
          antly as possible. Then the attendant under
          this method might make a mistake and be
          struck himself.
          The commission finally concluded that the
          best way would be to have the current pass
          through the hoad from the top to the back of
          the neck. One electrode is fitted to the top
          of the prisoner's head, another placed in con
          tact with the small of his back. The top
          electrode connects with the positive pole, the
          bottom with the negative pole. A leathern
          rest holds the prisoner's head and bands
          keep him from moving. The current, in go
          ing from one electrode to another, does not
          keep in a straight line, but spreads out and
          goes through the entire brain. It resembles
          somewhat a bundle of faggots tied at the two
          ends and swelling out in the middle. The seat
          of consciousness being in the brain, and the
          headquarters for all the nerves being located
          there, it is of course as plain as day that,
          when an electro-motive force of 8, 30 volts
          is applied, the prisoner is bound to die. The
          great beauty of this system is that the pris
          oners don't know it either.
          Heroe we have a villain who is too bad to
          stay around and commit murder any more.
          Step up, ladies and gentlemen, and gazoon
          the wayitisdone. Here we have astouttable
          covered with rubber cloth and having holes
          around its borders for binding. Prisoner,
          come up here and lieon the table. Attendant,
          bind the prisoner to the table. Here is an
          electrode (the negative one) which comes up
          through the table and touches the small of
          the prisoner's back. Here we have a helmet,
          to which the other electrode is joined, and
          t helmet is put on the prisoner's head. The
          Wtrode now touches the top of the prison
          9~head, which has been moistened bywarm
          ater. Prisoner, are you ready? Then, let
          'cgo, Gallagher, and the thing is done. The
          man is as dead as a
          door nail. Another
          modification of this
          method is to let the
          prisoner sit in a
          chair. Some pris
          oners will undoubt
          edly prefer to sit
          in a chair, whleilo
          others who were
          born tired will pro- e'O
          for to lie at full
          length. Eerthinug THE DEATH APPARATUS.
          will be done in regard to the com ort of the
          prisoners, and their taste will be consulted
          in every particular.
          This, in brief, is the way the prisoners will
          ""lick the bucket"" after the 1st of January.
          When Elbridgo T. Gerry, Mathew Hale
          and Alfred P. Southwick wero appointed last
          winter to investigate the matter they took
          the trouble to look up the various methods of
          Panishment in different countries.
          Now, however, the main object in
          to get the prisoner out of the way as soon as
          possible. In order to understand how quick
          a man can die under the force of electricity,
          let us consider first how fast a man can think.
          Well, it takes just one-tenth of a second fora
          nerve to communicate with the brain, ac
          cording to Professor Hemholz Now Pro
          fessor Tyndall estimates that an electric dis
          charge occurs in one hundred thousandth of
          a second, or ten thousand times more rapidly
          than nerve transmission. So you see that it
          it were possible a man would die by the
          process described ten thousand times before
          his nerves would have time to communicate
          with his brain.
          Last winter, for the purpose of ascertain
          ing the effect of the electric light current on
          the action of the heart, the thorax of a
          chloroformed dog caught in Buffalo was
          opened, so that the lungs and heart could be
          seen in action by forcing respiration as in
          conscious life. At the instant when the cur
          rent passed through the heart it became a
          mass of quivering flesh. It was noticed that
          an attempt to breathe was made after the
          current was passed through the dog. This
          indicated that the brain had not lost its sus
          ceptibility to impressions, and shows that in
          execution the current should be passed
          through the center. It should not be for
          gotten, however, that the dog was from
          utffalo. The commission couldheaveselected
          no tougher subject than a Buffalo dog.
          There can be no question, however, that
          electricity is the thing to do the business.

          prisoners, and their taste will be consulted
          in every particular.

          When Elbridgo T. Gerry, Mathew Hale
          and Alfred P. Southwick wero appointed last
          winter to investigate the matter they took
          the trouble to look up the various methods of
          Panishment in different countries.
          . In order to understand how quick
          a man can die under the force of electricity,
          let us consider first how fast a man can think.
          Well, it takes just one-tenth of a second fora
          nerve to communicate with the brain, ac
          cording to Professor Hemholz Now Pro
          fessor Tyndall estimates that an electric dis
          charge occurs in one hundred thousandth of
          a second, or ten thousand times more rapidly
          than nerve transmission. So you see that it
          it were possible a man would die by the
          process described ten thousand times before
          his nerves would have time to communicate
          with his brain.
          Last winter, for the purpose of ascertain
          ing the effect of the electric light current on
          the action of the heart, the thorax of a
          chloroformed dog caught in Buffalo was
          opened, so that the lungs and heart could be
          seen in action by forcing respiration as in
          conscious life. At the instant when the cur
          rent passed through the heart it became a
          mass of quivering flesh. It was noticed that
          an attempt to breathe was made after the
          current was passed through the dog. This
          indicated that the brain had not lost its sus
          ceptibility to impressions, and shows that in
          execution the current should be passed
          through the center. It should not be for
          gotten, however, that the dog was from
          utffalo. The commission couldheaveselected
          no tougher subject than a Buffalo dog.
          There can be no question, however, that
          electricity is the thing to do the business.

          murderer, was put to death In the

          mler ttas the first victim to be legal
          ly executed by electricity in tb Unit
          ed States and his case was the sub
          ject of wide discussion at the time.
          The action of New York In substitut
          ing the electric chair for the gallows
          has been found generally satisfact
          ory and her example has been fol
          lowed by Ohio, Virginia, South Caro

          New Jersey.

          there hae been 151 persona put to
          death In the electric chair In New
          York. The state prison authorities
          estimate that It costs about J4000 per
          individual to carry, out the capital
          punishment mandate. On the basis
          of Oils estimate New York state haa
          expended about JC3.000 for electro
          cutions since that form of Inflicting
          the death penalty was introduced.
          Several times the electric chair at
          Sing Sing has had two victims in
          one day, and on one occasion a short
          time ago three persons were put to
          death within a period of twenty-four
          hours. Rut never before has there
          been such a wholesale execution of
          death sentences Imposed on prison
          ers In this state as is scheduled to
          take place at Sing Sing next week.
          Nino men are to die on the same
          day, and In as rapid succession H3
          they can be led to the death chair.

          BECKER IS EXECUTED
          WITH PRAYER ON LIPS
          (Continued From Page 1.)
          The one time police officer hesitated
          as he entered the execution room. It
          seemed to the witnesses as if he was
          startled that the death chair was so
          near at hand. He looked quickly at
          the double row of witnesses, glanced
          at the floor, swept with his eyes the
          whitened walls of the room and then,
          suddenly, as if coming to himself,
          walked briskly over the rubber mat
          and seated himself in the electric
          chair. Behind Becker followed the
          prison priests chanting the prayer of
          death, which was repeated by the con
          demned man.
          ""Jesus, ijtfary, Joseph, hkve mercy on
          my soul,"" nervously spoke Becker as
          deputy wardens stepped forward and
          adjusted the electrodes. Hardly a
          minhte elapsed before the electrode
          was applied to the right leg, a slit
          having been previously cut in the
          trouser leg from the knee down. After
          the electrode had been firmly adjusted
          against a shaven spot on the back of
          the condemned man's head, the state
          executioner looked at Deputy Warden
          Johnson, who surveyed the figure that
          was ctlll mumbling the death prayer
          in the chair. Johnson half turned his
          head and the executioner jammed the
          switch.
          Three Shocks Given.
          The first shock lasted a full minute
          and the executioner said that it was
          1,850 volts and ten aniperes in
          strength. It came while Becker was
          still commending his soul to his
          niflknr.
          I The two prison physicians stepped
          forward to examine the collapsed flg
          ure that sat supported in the death
          chair by the thick black leather straps.
          The stethoscope was applied to the
          heart and Dr. Charles Farr, the prison
          physician, pressed his finger against
          the artery in the neck. There was
          still a feeble fluttering of the heart.'
          The physician stepped back from
          the rubber mat and again the electric
          current pulsed through the body. The
          shock lasted seven seconds and the
          current was then turned off. After 4
          hasty examination Dr. Farr asked that
          a third shock be given. This lasted
          nve seconds. An examination that
          took several minutes followed. Three
          physicians among the witnesses then
          made an examination and Dr.- Farr at
          5:55 o'clock proriounced Becker dead.
          Writes Last Statement.
          During the night Becker penciled on
          a piece of paper what he captioned
          ""My Dying Declaration."" It was tak
          en to the warden's office where two
          copies were typewritten, which Becker
          signed with his fountain pen in a bold

          Talks All Night.
          After his wife had said farewell,
          shortly after midnight, Becker main
          tained a casual conversation with
          Deputy Warden Johnson who sat be
          side tne screen in front of his cell.
          Sometimes he smoked cigars, after
          jwhich he would let his head fall on
          I his hand and gaze reflectively at the
          I floor for minutes at a time. Dawn
          found him seated on the edge of his
          cot carefully pinning a photograph of
          his wife on his white shirt just over
          his heart. Then, as if he desired to
          have her all to himself, Becker put on
          a thin black alpaca coat, which he
          tightly buttoned. The photograph was
          not seen by the witnesses until the
          prison"" physician opened his coat as he
          sat in the death chair.
          Becker was put to death by the state
          executioner whose name is unknown
          to the public. This man succeeded
          State Electrician Davis and he said he
          would not take the job unless his name
          wis kept secret. He lives in a little
          town up-state and went about his
          work briskly.
          Becker's executioner said that in his
          opinion the man had died instantly at
          the first contact.

          An autopsy on the body of Becker
          was performed, according to law, im
          mediately after the execution. After
          Becker's body had been removed from
          the electric chair, Samuel Haynes, a
          nefgro murderer, was brought into the
          execution room and electrocuted. One
          of Becker's last requests to Warden
          Osborne was that''he be put to death
          before Haynes.

          TWO ELECTROCUTED
          IN KENTUCKY JAIL
          Eddyville, Ky., July 30—For the
          third time in the history of Kentucky
          a double electrocution took place this
          morning at 3:30 o'clock at the Eddy
          ville penintiary.
          The firBt to be executed was Turn
          er Graham, Jr., 24, a white man, con
          victed for the killing of R. J. Mc
          Murtry, sheriff of Hardin county. The
          second was William Lane, 25, a negro,
          convicted at Pineville, on a charge of
          killing his wife. Lane was the first
          negro to be executed in Kentucky
          since the adoption of electrocution as
          a means of inflicting the death pen
          alty. Both men passed the night
          calmly and walked unassisted to the
          death chamber.

          History of Case.
          Herman Rosenthal, the gambler for
          whose murder Charles Becker was sen
          tenced to die in the electric chair, was
          shot to death by hired gunmen in the
          early morning of July 16, 1912, in front
          of the Hotel Metropole on Forty-third
          street, a few stepB from Broadway.
          The murder was' the swift culmination
          of sensational charges made a few
          days before by Rosenthal against Beck
          er in which Rosenthal asserted that
          Becker, then head of the strong arm
          squad of detectives, freely sold police
          protection and had accumulated thou
          sands of dollars of graft money.

          Scientists Have Just Discovered
          Many Secrets Which Have Long
          Puzzled Them in Regard to Death
          by Electric Shock From the Exper
          ience of a Man Who Was Electro
          cuted and Brought
          Back to Life
          WHKN the electric chair was sub
          stituted for the old fashioned
          gallows in New York it was be
          cause it was believed that electrocution
          was painless. But just what were the
          sensations of death in the electric chair
          scientists were unable to say, because
          no electrocuted victim came back to life
          to tell tliern.
          It was assumed that the shock of the
          powerful current would instantly render
          the condemned man unconscious. But
          the unpleasant feature of m^st electro
          cutions has been the necessity of re
          penting the shock several times. This
          was not foreseen
          Experience in ilie death chamber has
          shown that the electric current does
          not usually destroy life at the tirst shock.
          Evidences of pulsating life compel the
          executioner to turn on the current asain
          and yet again. This distressing failure
          of the electric charge to instantly end
          life has caused much speculation among
          scientists and humanitarians.
          Does the first shock end the conscious
          ness of the condemned man?
          Or is the victim siiil conscious?hover
          ing between death and life, does themau
          In the chair realize what is going on?
          What, if any, was the agony of the
          ti rs shock?
          What were the agonies of the victim
          during the moments elapsing between
          tiie tirst shock and the second impact of
          the current? Was he entirely uncon
          scious, partly conscious or fully conscious
          of the horrors of the situation which the
          law never meant to be inflicted on him?
          And if the tirst shock of the current
          benumbed the condemned man's brain,
          did returning consciousness bring with it
          tortures of bodily misery which have
          never been known or suspected?
          The Victim
          Falls Apparently Dead.
          Nobody has been able to answer these
          questions until an accident happened
          viiit-h unexpectedly illuminated this wholo
          subject of what the victim in the elec
          tric chair really sees, hears, foels and

          Associated Press Special.
          J Richmond, Va., Nov. 14.—Henry
          Clay Beattie, Jr., wag electrocuted In
          I the death chamber of the state pent
          lentlary this morning at 7:2i
          o’clock. One minute after the shock
          he was pronounced dead by the at
          tending physicians.
          After the execution of Beattie It
          was learned that he confessed to the
          murder of his wife. Although the
          prison authorities who were present
          at the execution said that Beattie
          made no statements which might be
          construed as an admission of guilt.
          It was afterwards learned that he
          lert a written statement with his
          spiritual advisers In which he admit
          ted his guilt. This statement was
          given out by the family some time
          after young Beattie's death.
          The confession of Beattie, which
          bore hla signature. Is aa follow*:
          “I, Henry Clay Beattie, Jr., desir
          ous of standing right before Ood and
          man, do on this the twenty-third day
          of November, confess my guilt of
          the crime against me. Much that has
          been published concerning the de
          tails was not true, but the awful
          fact without harrowing clrcumstau
          ces remain. For this action I am tru
          ly Borry, but believing that I am at
          peace with God and am soon to pa
          Into his presence, this statement Is
          made.”
          Beattie went to the death dealing
          chair unshaken and displaying the
          same remarkable nerve that charac
          terized him throughout the entire
          trial of his case and his subsequent
          fight to escape the chair.
          During his last night on earth
          Beattie slept well, but tossed rest
          lessly as though bad dreams had
          been his companions throughout the
          long time. There were no signs of a
          breakdown when he arose this morn
          ing, the prisoner dressing with the
          same fastidious care that he has
          taken ever since he entered the state
          penitentiary and the death cell.
          The death chamber Is undor
          ground and the only light waa above
          the death chair where It seemed to
          culminate with a ghastly glare and
          to leave the balance of th* room In
          almost total darkness. The twelve
          witnesses required by law wero
          ranged along the sides of th* cham
          ber back In this grewsome darkness.
          During the few momenta Beattie
          was a'lve after he entered the death
          chamber he saw nothing but the
          chair in which he was to be rtrapped
          to receive the deadly current.

          Sullivan Asked to Aid Youth
          Who Survived Death Chair
          By the Associated Press
          Gael Sullivan, executive director
          of the Democratic National Com-j
          mittee, said yesterday a group of i
          educators has asked his aid in seek
          ing executive clemency for Willie
          Francis, young Negro facing a sec
          ond trip to the electric chair in
          Louisiana.
          Mr. Sullivan told reporters he Is
          studying the case, but has taken no
          action and did not know what he
          might do. He discussed the matter
          when asked about reports that he
          would ask President Truman to
          commute Francis’ sentence.
          Francis, convicted of a holdup
          killing, went to the electric chair
          once but escaped death due to me
          chanical difficulties with the chair.
          His attorneys appealed to the Su
          preme Court to save him from a
          second trip to the chair, contending
          that would be cruel and unusual
          punishment barred by the Consti
          tution. The court split sharply on
          the question, but the majority held
          j Louisiana may legally attempt once
          j again to execute him.

            You might think that a girl whose brother had been dashed to death In an aeroplane would be about the last girl to take up aeroplan-Ing as a profession. Not so with Mathilde Moisant. There are so few women now fly-ing that she may be said to be one of the first to go into the game. She is taking lessons daily at Min-eola, and expects before many weeks to be earning money as an aviator. Miss Moisant Is a handsome young woman, of the dark, Span-ish type, spirited in her speech and actions, and there seems little doubt that she will make good. She has all the necessary nerve, and while she is Btill in the ""grass-cutting"" stage of flying, she is learning very rapidly to guide and control her machine. ""My brother John always told me,"" she says, ""that to be a suc-cessful flyer meant to anticipate every move of the machine, and to be able to take steps to meet an emergency the Instant it occurred. That la what I am trying con-stantly to keep in mind."" After John was killed, I vowed never to get Into an aeroplane again, but the old longing that I had always had, when I saw him fly, came back, until I was no longer able to resist It. My fam-ily has opposed me In every way, but I am determined. No Fear In Machine. ""I think anyone can learn to fly, but I don't think everyone can learn to be a really great aviator, and that Is what I Intend to be-come. I think it is born In me. I have no feeling of fear when I get into a machine. I know I shall learn to do the things John did-, and perhaps more than he ever did."" Although supposed to stick to the ground, Miss Moisant made a flight a few days ago, greatly to the surprise of her instructor, An-drew Haupert. She pulled the clutch without knowing it and shifted her planes so as to send the machine up in the air several feet. She landed as lightly as a bird. Miss Moisant has her brother's famous cat, ""Paris-London,"" and he flies with her as he did with the ill-fated aviator who carried him across the channel. "

            NEW YORK, Oct. 16. Miss Mathilda Moissant, at the aviation field in Mineola, Long Island, this evening made a flight which was as good as any since the spring. Friends from South America and France had come to the field, and it was for their benefit that she gave the exhibition.  
            Leaving the field, she arose 1,500 feet. [Special Dispatch to The Call] She flew across to Meadowbrook and Westbury, flew south, crossing the motor parkway, and kept on until she was over the Great South Bay.  
            On her return flight, when she flew over the field, she made several sensational dips, to the terror of her friends, who feared she was falling, but she alighted gracefully."

            here recently. Her machine struck a
            ridge of earth Just outside the base

            up with the young woman still In her
            scat, but the framework crumpled
            from the Impact. In an instant the

            ""3 Removal of all economic barriers and establishment
            of equality of trade conditions among nations consenting to
            peace and associating themselves for its maintenance.
            ""4 Guarantees for the reduction of national armaments
            to the lowest point consistent with domestic safety.
            ""5 Impartial adjustment of all colonial claims based
            upon the principle that the peoples concerned have equal
            weight with the interest of the Government.
            ""6 Evacuation of nil Russian territory and opportunity
            for Russia's political development.
            ""7 Evacuation of Belgium without any attempt to
            limit her sovereignty.
            ""8 All French territory to be freed and restored, and
            reparation for the taking of Alsace-Lorraine.
            ""9 Readjustment of Italy's frontiers along clearly
            recognizable lines of nationality.
            ""10 Freest opportunity for autonomous development
            of the peoples of Austria-Hungary.
            ""11 Evacuation of Roumnnin, Serbia and Montenegro,
            with access to the sea for Serbia, and international guaran
            tees of economic and political independence and territorial
            integrity of the Balkan states.
            ""12 Secure sovereignty for Turkey's portion of the
            Ottoman Empire, but with other nationalities under Turkish
            rule assured security of life and opportunity for autonomous
            development, with the Dardanelles permanently opened to
            all nations.
            ""13 Establishment of an independent Polish state, in
            cluding territories inhabitated by indisputably Polish popula
            tion, with free access to the sea and political and economic
            independence and territorial integrity guaranteed by inter
            national covenant.
            ""14 General association of nations under specific
            covenants for mutual guarantees of political independence
            and territorial integrity to large and small states alike.

            PARIS, Feb. 14. The first world
            constitution was made public this af
            ternoon when President Wilson read
            the draft of the league of nations er
            ganizaticn before the general peac
            congress.
            ""While not containing a provisioa
            for any sort of international police
            force, the constitution iwciwie
            striegent-raeasures designed to prc

            tion there are the following possible
            courses open to the league:
            Slay Combine Against Olfcwter.
            Severance of diplomatic relations
            between members of tho league asi
            the recalcitrant power.

            refusing arbitration.
            Recommendation by the executive
            council fccforc the use of force.
            The use of force, however, will
            leave to each power freedom of ac
            tion under its action to make the
            necessary declarations of war.
            The international police force, or
            general staff, urged by the French,
            and put to a vote yesterday after
            noon after a stirring speech by Sen
            ator Kourgcois was overwhelmingly
            defeated. Only the French and
            Czechs-Slovaks voted in favor o it.
            With this feature eliminated the con
            stitution was adopted unanimously.
            Add Five New Articles.
            The constitution includes a pre
            amble and twenty-six articles,
            having teen increased from the orig
            inal twenty-two articles during yes
            terday's session of the league com
            mittee. The last articles arc devoted
            to purely parliamentary matters, the
            others covering organization of the
            league.
            Congratulations on securing adop
            tion of the league constitution poured
            in to American headquarters at the
            Hotel Crillon before this afternoon's
            plenary session. Members of the
            League to Enforce Peace declared
            this ""is the golden day in the history
            of the world."" They declared that,
            despite rumors circulated in Paris
            France s solidly behind the league

              PARIS, April 11 (By The Associated
              |Pres3).--Discussion of the Monroe
              Doctrine amendment by the league of
              nations commission last night is de?
              scribed by those present as having
              been nf a dramatic character, conclud
              ing with a speech by President Wilson
              deprecating the opposition which had
              been expressed nnd upholding the doc?
              trine as one of the great bulwarks
              against absolutism. The debate came
              lato in the session, after other sub
              jects had been passed upon.
              The British attitude had been in
              doubt until the last, but Lord Robert.
              Cecil turned the scales by announcing
              that he savv no objection in the amend?
              ment in the form presented by the
              President. M. Larnaude, of the French
              delegation, followed Lord Robert with
              objections to inserting the Monroe
              Doctrine.
              The Chinese also offcred objection to
              the amendment on the ground that its
              i language war. so extended that it might
              validate certain principles and claims
              J affecting Chinese affairs.
              Tho President paid thc closest at-
              tention to the opposition to the amend?
              ment and jotted down notes for a re?
              ply. In his speech the President spoke
              with great enrnestness and with some
              evidence of feeling.
              The President declared the .Monroe
              Doctrine was enunciated t.o combat. the
              Holy Alliance nnd to hold back the
              throat of absolutism which was then
              menacing Europe and seeking to spread
              its power to the Western Hemisphere.
              It. served its purpose in keeping this
              absolute power from the Wesvtern
              World
              One of its great purposes, he said,
              was to raaintain territorial and politi?
              cal integrity, and. having served its
              great purpose in the Western World, it
              now was being brought to the lands
              which had felt the hand of absolutism
              and militarism. It was a source of sur
              prise and discouragement, the Presi?
              dent said, to hear opposition expressed
              to such a doctrine and such a purpose.
              The President's speech closed thc
              4iscussion. There was no vote, and,
              when there were no further remarks,
              the chairman of the meeting said the
              amendment would be considered adopt?
              ed. The commission thi n took up the
              next article of the covenant.
              While the text of the .Monroe amend?
              ment is withheld, its main features are
              substantially along the following line
              ""Article X -Nothing in this cove?
              nant shall be construed as invali
              dating any agreement, such as th""
              Monroe Doctrine, for the maintcnanc
              of peace.""
              The exact language of the amend?
              ment ia closely guard* d, and i ffoi
              to obtain a copy of the text met with
              the statement that although there iS

              announcement there was 110 reason or

              The first official act of the council

              to Swing the Assembly on
              the Important Question

              GENEVA, Nov. 13.?The scenery is
              all set for the opening of the League
              of Nations assembly Monday. All the
              delegates from forty-one countries are
              now present, with the notable exception
              of Arthur Balfour, of Great Britain,
              who has been slightly ill and will not
              reach Geneva until the middle of the
              week.
              Elaborate preparations have b?en
              made for the first historic meeting in
              the Hall of Reformation. The flags of
              twoscore states, with the exception of
              the United States, Germany and Rus?
              sia, are flying from the hotels and pub?
              lic buildings, while the hall itself is a
              mass of color.
              Geneva is just beginning to realize
              what an important responsibility it ac?
              cepted when it became the headquar?
              ters of the League of Nations, but it is
              Handling the unexpectedly large num?
              ber of distinguished visitors in a way
              such as only experienced hosts could.
              The state authorities are making'
              every effort to assist the league. Mo*v i
              of the Swiss are sincere supporters of:
              the organization.
              Germany the Big Issue
              The final meeting of the league coun-
              eil before the assembly gave the mem- j
              bers an opportunity to consider the
              program to be followed at the meetings
              at this place and to canvass opinion
              j on such questions as mandates, the
              protection of minorities, international
              finance and the Polish-Lithuanian dis-
              pute. Although all of these matters
              are to be under discussion, that of j
              chief importance among them all is
              Germany.
              Most of the delegates arrived with
              instructions as to their attitude to?
              ward the .admission of Germany to the
              league, but the situation shifts hourly
              and it is difficult to say exactly what
              the final turnup will be. Lloyd George
              is expected to make a dramatic ap?
              pearance some day next week and

              Resolved, That America Should Join

              AFFIRMATIVE.
              America should join the League to
              protect tc* liberties of the world.

              which Washington fought for;
              it would be contrary to the ideals
              which sent our sons to France. The
              oppressed peoples of Europe look to
              us to show them the way to freedom.

              America has failed I America made,
              a little essay at generosity and then
              withdrew.
              America said, 'We are your
              friends,' but it was only for today,,
              not for tomorrow. America said,;
              'Here is our power to vindicate right' j
              and the next day said, 'Let right take
              care of itself, and we will take care,
              of ourselves.' America said, 'Wej

              To Senator Reed of Missouri belongs the distinction of discover
              ing in the proposed League of Nations to Enforce Peace a treasonable
              conspiracy against the honor and interests of the United States. Such
              a league, he says, would involve us in every European quarrel; it
              would expose the president to the cabals of raonarchs, all closely re
              lated; it would necessarily result in the creation of an international
              army powerful enough to coerce any nation, the United states in
              eluded, of course, which in time might be commanded by a German
              field marshal, and in, its councils, eacn nation voting as a unit, this
              mighty republic would have no more influence than Hayti or Liberia.
              If the senator can-be made to understand that the League of
              Nations is not altogether a hallucination but a practical conception of
              international action which is soberly indorsed by many far-seeing
              men, he will realize that every one of his objections has been or will
              be answered, the New-York World declares. We hesitate to assume
              that Mr. Reed has intentionally misrepresented the plan which he as
              sails, but, plainly enough, he is lll-inrormed as to its inspiration and
              purpose.
              The war now ending has shown that never again can wre ignore
              European quarrels. We did our best some people thought our worst
              --to keep out of this one, and failed. The nations of the earth are
              too closely associated to hope ever again to be disinterested observers
              of war between important belligerents. In that role we suffered
              many wrongs and humiliations, and the-neutrality of such states as
              Holland, Norway and Denmark has been hardly less costly than war.
              A League of Nations has always beenpredicated upon the dls
              appearance of autoeracyy-which has been the parent of aggresion
              and strife. The last of the autocrats has gone, and the monarchs of
              whom Mr. Reed stands in such fear have less actual power than the
              governor of an American commonwealth.
              How a League of Nations would arrive at its conclusions and en
              force them against offenders has not yet been worked out, but we
              think it must be.taken for granted that before such an organization
              can be effected the purpose of the world to maintain peace and jus
              tice will be made known beyond a peradventure, and that, with that
              common aim once established, the method by which it is to be at
              tained will be reached without much difficulty. Afterall, it is noth
              ing but democratic self-government on a large scale, j
              Inother words, a League of Nations presupposes a membership
              of free and civilized and not enslaved and savage nations. It must
              rest also to some extent upon mutual respect and confidence. To be
              effective it must mckide every considerable nation. Its success will
              depend more upon the principles of its members than upon any meas
              ures of disarmament, although it is expected, of course, that in time
              the great war machines ot the present day will be seen no more.
              Such a League of Nations as most people have in mind wHl not
              execute its decrees with the sword, and so Mr. Reed's hideous dream
              that a German may in time lead an overpowering international force
              against the United States falls to the ground. Its' discipline in the
              first instance will be commercial and financial. No unruly govern
              ment can long survive an international boycott. None but unruly
              peoples need fear anything more drastic than that.
              A Leagiie of Nations to Enforce Peace should be no more ter
              rible to well-disposed nations than the rule of law to communities
              long subject to assassins, mobs and lynchers. It would seem that this
              truth might appeal to Mr. Reed as a distinguished member of the
              bar, even if he were not a senator of the United States.

              Under the name of ""mandates” of
              the League of Nations, a military gov
              ernment is being imposed upon Meso
              potamia and Syria. It may be neces
              sary; but it is neither necessary nor
              proper that the United States shall
              become a party to it. Whether we
              shall or not not may be finally deter
              mined by the senate, and by a single
              vote in the senate.
              The Republican party proposes to
              maintain those separate fortunes for
              which our fathers fought. America
              independence of Europe has meant
              much for the world as well as for
              ourselves, and its sacrifice would be
              a sacrifice for all mankind as well
              ns for ourselves.
              ~lf disarmament can be brought
              about it will be by friendly agreement,
              as with Canada, and not by a military
              league, as established at Paris.
              If the future peace of the world
              is to encouraged, it will be by the
              eonditieation of international law and
              the establishment of a court of law
              judges, to which the nations, in a free
              association will submit disputes.
              Only war will come from the setting
              up a centralized military power,
              which by its assembly, exercising, as
              the President has said, ""the major
              forces of mankind."" will subject the
              world to an unscrupulous and irre
              sponsible politicial and military des
              potism.
              Thi! Democratic party will deny
              that such a power will be unscroupu
              lous or despotic. The history of the
              world proves that It will be.
              The safeguard of the nation Is the
              election of u senate pledged to sup
              port our Constitution, or interests,
              and our American policies of peace
              and friendship with all nations and
              governmental union with none. We
              have fought four wars with Eunropean
              nations to prevent the control of
              American affairs by Europe, and won
              them all. It is certain that if the
              League of Nations had been in exist
              ence we would never have gained our
              independence. Do not let us now
              commit the supreme folly an dthe “su
              preme sacrifice” of voluntarily sur
              rendering the independence and sepa

              Governor Cox states that as president he will bring the League
              of Nations before the senate at the tirst opportunity for ratification
              with any helpful reservations that are advanced.
              Senator Harding states that the League of Nations is dead, that
              he is against it and so the issue is clearly denned.
              In the event of the election of Governor Cox the first official act
              he performs will be to enter the United States in the League of Na

              in the future through the agreement of the nations of the world act

              Senator Harding offers no substitute. He is -boldly, unutter
              ably against the League of Nations.
              This is the situation presenting itself in this campaign. Will
              the American people vote for Cox and the League of Nations or will
              they follow blindly a candidate who offers them nothing tangible
              to prevent future devastating wars?

         By JAMES A.EDGERTON THE dissapearance of the famous ""Mona Lisa"" of Leondardo da Vinci from the Louvre, at Paris, is the lastest nine days' wonder in the world of art. This great painting, also known as ""La Giocondo"", has been pronounced by many the finest in the world.
         It certainely stands in a list of the world's half dozen greatest paintings and in popular regard perhaps ranks second only to the ""Sistine Madinna"" by Raphael. Some think ""The Last Supper,"" also by Da Vinci, greater than ""Mona Lisa,"" but this sort of comparison is fruitless, as the two paintings 
         are quite different in the subject and treatment. The loss of this picture is regarded by the FRench as a national calamity. To them it is not only priceless, but a part of their very life. It has been reported, and is probably true, that the French government once refused an offer of $5,000,000 for the painting. 
         Upon its dissapearance the Louvre was closed for several dats, a large force of police was set to work searching every nook and cranny of the great building, and sixty detectives were started working on the outside. One of the theories of the authorities was that the theif was a young man who was known to have become enamored of the painting and who had visitedit at intervals 
         for several months, sitting before it with a rapt expression for hours together. They believe that he fell in love with the face, as painters have been known to become enamored of their own works, and grew insane upon the subject, his mania finally prompting the crime. So much people were affected by this masterpiece that some shed tears at sight of it. Not a few letters have been received at the Louvre addressed to ""Mona Lisa"" and expressing love to her as to a living person.
         That the deed was the owrk of some deranged person seems almost certain for the reason that the picture could not be disposed of and hence would be without value of the thief. A painting is only valuable when shown. If the criminal could dispose of i to a private collector and it cannot be conceived that any thief would dare to offer it for sale or that any collector would be so foolish or depraved as to buy such collector would not dare exhibit it for fear of detection. While there are many
         copies of the painting that the average man could hardly detect from the original, there are always those who can distinguish and now that the whoel world is on the lookout for the picrure every copy will be subjected to closer inspection. Moreover, an old master is chiefly valuable because it is an original, and to be able to refer to it as such and to know in his heart that the claim is true constitute its chief value to the collector; hence insanity of one form or another is the only rational explanation of the act. That paradox and all.
         An interesting fact in this connection is that several months ago it was reported in the public print that ""Mona Lisa"" had been stolen and a copy substituted in its place. This was afterward denied, but the dissappearance now makes it seem a strange coincidence, almost a prophecy. There is one other possible explanation. It is notorious that in Europe the trade of making fake ""old masters"" flourishes apace, chiefly for the purpose of guilling American millionaires. These copies are properly aged by processes that the fakers know and are then sold for
         fabulous prices to those who have more money than expert knowledge or perhaps real appreciation of ""old masters."" To do this work fakers have to posses originals in order that the copy may be as nearly perfect as possible. Sometimes these imitiations are so close that they fool even the experts. Many pictures have been stolen in the past, but none even approaching the values of ""Mona Lisa."" The most famous case in modern times was the theft of Gainsborough's famous portrait of the ""Duchess of Devonshire."" The ""electioneering duchess"" she was called, having been active in her husband's
         political canvasses. This painting was missing nearly a quarter of a century and was finally returned through the instrumentality of the late Pat Sheedy, the ""square"" gambler. Sheedy's version of the affair was that the theif was Adam Worth, whom Sheedy regarded as the greatest criminal of the last century. The painting wasoriginally stolen to be used in an effort to get one of Worth's accomplices out of jail. The man escaped on a technicality, however, and Worth had the picture on his hands. He did not dare to sell it or even to mention its existence. The painting was kept in a hermetically sealed case in the false bottom of a trunk. The Pinkertons,
         believed that Worth wasthe thief, but could not prove it. This is where Sheedy came into the case. Worth had at one time done Sheedy a kindness-$2000 worth of kindness, to be exact. Pinkerton heard of this and asked Sheedy that if he ever saw Worth again to find out about the Gainsborough. Some years later, when Sheedy was running a gambling joint in Constantinople, he received word from Adam Worth, who was in trouble, as usual. Sheedy, of course, more than made good the former loan and got Worth out. He then mentioned the matter of the Gainsvorough, and Worth replied that he was on the point of breaking the ice on that subject himself. The upshot of it all was that Sheedy acted as a go-between 
         got the picture out of the false bottom of the trunk where it was in storage in Boston, had the British owners over to examine it, collected the $25,000 reward, presumably turned over the money to Adam Worth and his pals and as a result of the incident got into ""art"" himself. Worth was so grateful for Sheedy's action in the Gainsborough affair that before his death he insisted on giving Pat an original Murillo which had been stolen out of some monastery. When this came into his hands Sheedy tried to find the rightful owners, advertising extensively in South America and elsewhere, but failed. Some years later he heard that Raisuli, the Moroccan bandit, had in his possession a Correggio, which was also
         obtained. Pat;s reputation as a connoisseur in high art was made.

         On August 21, 1911, the picture was missed from its place in the Louvre.The guard thought the official photographer had taken it to his studio to copy it, as he often did. It was not until late Tuesday evening that the guard announced the picture had been stolen. After a hasty search, heavy frame was found under a stairway leading to one of the cloakrooms. A scaffold against the facade of the Louvre, placed there in connection with the installation of an elevator, made it easy to enter or leave the building. A persom acquainted with the interior and provided with keys to the various rooms could easily reach the Salon Carre where the picture hung. Some say the portrait was stolen as an object lesson, to show how
         careless the keepers of the Louvre were and how easily pictures could be stolen. Others think perhaps an artist has stolen it and will return a reproduction and keep the original, or that a big reward will be demanded and its payment the picture will be returned in an indirect way after the excitement has dies down. More romantic than any of these conjectures is that ""Mona Lisa"" is another Helen of Troy. Some one has fallen in love with her and in desperation carried her off to his secret altar from the stare of the croeds and jealousy guard her from the eyes of other worshipers.
         Where ""Mona Lisa"" is hidden, she is carefully guarded, for no trace has been found; and Paris, as well as thousands of sightseers who have gazed upon her beauty, are still wondering and talking of her dissappearance.

         Trying to Steal Mona Lisa's Sister How the Authorities at the Louvre Hope to Save Leonardo da Vinci's Other Masterpiece from the Fate That Overtook ""La Joconde."" PAris, SINCE ""Mona Lisa"" was so mysteriously stolen from the Louvre, the authorities of that world-famous art museum have been warned, and have taken unusual precautions to save Leonardo da Vinci's sister masterpiece from a similar fate. This painting, equally esteemed by art connoisseurs, but overshadowed for the mass of visitors by the enormous fame of ""Mona Lisa""
         -or ""La Joconde,"" as the French call it, because of its haunting smile-is an idealized portrait od Lucrezia Crevelli, the beautiful young Lombard poetess who inspired Lombardo's brush during the earlier period of his fame. Owing to the jewelled band which encircles the brow, the picture is called ""La Belle Ferronniere."" In this case Leonardo performed marvels with a pair of wonderful eyes, which are hardly less compelling in their influence than the elusive smile of ""Mona Lisa."" paris devotees at the shrine of the great Lombardo have always divided
         their acts of devotion pretty equally between ""Mona Lisa"" and ""La Belle Ferronniere,"" standing before them for hours in evident rapture over that smile and those eyes, and then going home and writing love letters to them. These love letters of prtraits of Italian beauties three hundred yeaers in their graves are always opened and read by the Louvre authorities. To the writer of some such letters they attribute the theft of ""Mona Lisa."" Since the dissappearance of that masterpiece the devotional visits and letters to ""La Belle Ferronnieere"" have doubled in numbers, and the actions
         of some of the visitors and letter writers have been so fanatical that the painting has been placed under a competent guard night a day. It is also guarded against a too close approach by nay but its official custodians. When Leonardo da Vincii painted Lucrezia he was still a ""primitive."" He had not yet discovered the effect of light and atmonsphere When he painted the poetess he was a pagan-when he produced ""Mona Lisa"" he was a mystic. Not less marvellous either in conception or execution is the portrait of Lucrezia than that of her better known sister. It is more subtle more difficult to understand,
         that is all. In all the world there does not exist more than a baker's dozen of absolutely authentic paintings by Leonardo. He produced but one great work of sculpture, a esquestrain statue that stood before the feudal castle of his princely, but illigigtimate ancestors, the Sforzesco family of Milan. During the wars that swept over Europe between Charles the Fifth, Henry the Eigth and Francis the First, from which northern Itlay suffered so much and when so many princely treasures were destroyed, this historic monument and the majority of da Vinci's paintings dissappeared. Since the recent dissapearance of the ""Mona Lisa"" a most
         rigid surveillance is kept over this other great portrait. Already the fickle public is fast losing interest over the lost ""Mona Lisa"" and the beautiful poetess who held the younger Leonardo under her magic sway is to replace the sphinx-like ""La 
         Joconde."" Instead if the unfathomable smile, one ponders over the tempting bow-mouth, the finely chiselled lips with a sensitive turn at the corners; instead of those glistening with humor, sometimes cruel and snake-like, ever enigmatical, ine revels in the depths of those glorious eyes that Leonardo has preserved for us those great intresting eyes of the Lombard poetess whose inner mind is so revealed in the face yet who seems to ask the question that ""Mona Lisa"" knew and defied the world to answer. It was the Salle Carre(Square Hall) of the Louvre that contained ""Mona Lisa,"" as ther the light is most favorable. That the equally beautiful ""La Belle Ferronniere"" has been kept in the semi-seclusion of the long, narrow gallery, however has not hidden it from Leonardo enthusiasts, and now the general public has discovered the
         sister painting, thronging the less favired gallery and adding to the perplexities of the custodians.

FLORENCE Italy, December 13.-the authenticity ofthe ""Mona Lisa"" found yesterday in possession of Vincenzo Perguia was confirmed by experts after further examination today. The picture bears the seals of the Louvre and other galleries in which it has been hung, while the traces of repairs ar the back of the canvas also are visible. The prisoner was again interrogated by the police authorities this morning. He
        repeated his story of having stolen the picture as an act of patriotic vengeance for Napoleon's depredations in Italy. He displayed the utmost indignation at his treatment by the police, declaring it unjust after the risks he had run and the abnegation he had demonstrated out of patriotic sentiment. A number of prominent Italians have written to the Italian piblic instruction requesting him to permit ""Mona Lisa"" to be placed on exhibition in Florence, its former home, before returning it to the French government. Some weeks ago an Italian wrote to Signor Geri, an antiquary of Florence, saying :""I am in possession of the missing ""Mona Lisa, "" but being a patriotic Italian I desire that it shall reamian in Florence, the center of Italian art."" he igned the letter ""Leonard,"" and the antiquary at first paid small attention to it, thinking he had to do with a madman . Later, however, he communicated with Dr. Poggi, director of the Florentine museums, who suggested that he continue the correspondence with the man. This was done, and an appointment was arranged whereby Geri was to view the picture at Milan.
        The date set was November 17, but unforseen circumstances prevented the meeting. Recognizes ""Mona Lisa."" A young man fairly well dressed, visited Geri thursday.

On being interrogated the prisoner said his real name is Vincenzo Perugia, thathe was born in the province of como, is by profession a decorator, and is unmarried. For six years he lived in France, and for three years was employed at the Louvre. Perugia posed as a patriot. ""I was ashamed he said, ""that for more than a century no Italian had thought of avenging the spoliation committed by Frenchmen under Napoleon, when they carried off from the Italian mueseums and
        galleries pictures, status and treasures of all kinds by wagonloads, ancient manuscripts by thousands, and gold by sacks."" Stolen Early in Morning He had often observed, he said, in the Louvre many works of art stolen from Italy, and conceived the idea of returning to its true home Leonardo da Vinci's masterpiece. He entered the Louvre early in the morning, detached the pciture beneath his workman's blouse, and succeeded in leaving the place without attracting suspicion. At the time of the theft Perugia was not employed in the Louvre, but he knew all the exits and entrances, and how to avoid attention. He kept the painting concealed. he said, until his patriotism led him to offer it to the Italian people. the picture was identified by Dr. Corrado Ricci, director general of the department of fine arts, who was dispatched hurriedly to Florence from Rome by the minister of public instruction, Luigi Credaro. Finger Prints Confirm Confession. PARIS, December 13.-Rene Viviani, French minister of the public instruction, announced at the cabinet council today that there was no doubt the picture ""Mona Lisa"" had been recovered and was now at Florence, Italy.
        He said he had telegraphed to the Italian premier thanking him and the Italian government for their prompt action. A representative of the fine arts department is on the way to Rome to bring the picture back to Paris. Fresh proof that ""Mona Lisa"" was taken from the Louvre by Vincenzo Perugia was established today when his finger prints taken when he was convincted some time ago of carrying firearms without a permit were compared with those on the frame and glass of the picture and found exactly similar. The finger prints on the glass and frame were preserved by the police and the similarity with those of Perugia is apparent. Excitement in Paris. With ""Mona Lisa"" found what was one of the unfathomable mysteries has been solved. The sensatuon caused by its recovery was equaled only by that caused by its dissappearance in August, 1911. Special editions of the newspapers carried the news the length and breadth of Paris, and last night it was the sole topic of conversation. The Florence dealer, Geri, it iis believed, will be entitled to claim reqards amounting to 240,000 francs ($48,000) offered by the Society of Friends of the Louvre and Paris newspapers. 
        Regarded as Priceless. ""Mona Lisa,"" or ""La Joconde,"" is one of the world's famous paintings, and regarded as priceless. Leonardo da Vinci took as his model for the pictureLisa del S=GIocondo, a woman of Florence. He worked on the picture for four years, from 1500 to 1504. It was bought for France by Francis I. The value of the work can only be imagined since all offers to buy it were refused, among them ine reported to have been made by the British government of $5,000,000. The famous painting had hung in the place of honor in the Louvre in a room which was supposed to be always watched. It dissappeared on the morning of August 22, 1911, and its absence was not noticed by its guardians until some hours later.

Expelled Director Joyous. M.J.Thomolele, who was director of the Louvre when ""Mona Lisa"" was stolen, and who was suspended by the French cabinet because of the loss of the painting, was overcome with jou when he learned of its recovery. Seymour de ricci, an eminent art critic of Paris, declared his faith in the certification of Dr. Corrado Ricci at Florenece of authenticity of the ""Mona Lisa"". ""I do not think there is the slightest doubt,"" he said, ""that the painting will be restored immediately to France."" Italy has no claim whatever on the ""Mona Lisa,"" which was given or sold to the French king, Francis I, by Leonardo da Vinci himslef. M. Viviani, minister of public instruction and M. Jacqueir, under-secretary for beaux arts, were both highlt elated over the auspicious event which ushers in their term of office. The Itlaian government has advised them that it will deliver over the picture at once and they are considering the best and safest means of conveying it back to the Louvre.
        The french government will take the earliest opportunity to express its gratitude to the italian givernment for the great service it has rendered in restoring the lost treasure. Perguia resided near the St. Louis hospital. He left here hurridely on Wednesday, saying he was obliged to go to Italy on important business. He is 22 years of age. The son of a carpenter. He came to Paris every year during the season and earned about eight francsa day, returning to some village when work was slack. Outside of a few compatriots, humble workers like himself, he was not known to have any friends in Paris. A neighbot of Perguia described him as an ordianry workman, having no special technical knowledge and completely ignorant in artistic matters. The neighbor, therefore, was astonished to hear that Perugia was accused of stealing the painting and believed that id the accusation were true he could only have been acting at the istigation of someone who had exploited his patriotic sentiments. It was possible, said the man, that Perugia had worked at the Louvre, but neither his relativesnor friends ever have heard it.

Signor Credaro announced that Italy would apply the same generosity. He said he had immediately notified the French embassador, Camille Barrere of the discovery of the painting. He added: ""Mona Lisa"" will be delivered to the embassador with a solemnity worthy of Leonardo da Vinci and a spirit of happiness worthy of 'Mona Lisa's' smile. Although the masterpiece is dear to all Italians as one of the best productions of the genuis of their race, we will willingly return it to its foster country, which has regretted its loss so bitterly,as a fresh pledge of friendship and brotherhood between the two great Latin nations."" The painting is in an almost perfect state of preservation, not withstanding the vicissitudes it must have undergone. Perguia, although he has not made a complete confession,

Although the masterpiece is dear to all Italians as one of the best productions of the genius of their race, we will willingly return it to its foster country, which has regretted its loss so bitterly, as a fresh pledge of friendship and brotherhood between the two great Latin nations.""  The painting is in an almost perfect state of preservation, notwithstanding the vicissitudes it must have undergone. Perugia, although he has not made a complete confession, has admitted that he 
         concealed it under the false bottom of a trunk or fixed it behind the canvas of a worthless sketch. Sensation in Paris. PARIS, Dec. 12—The sensation caused by the recovery of 'Mona Lisa' was only equaled by that caused by its disappearance in August, 1911. Special editions of the newspapers carried the news the length and breadth of Paris, and tonight it was the sole topic of conversation. The finding of 'Mona Lisa' had been so often announced, only to be contradicted, that the news was at first received with skepticism. However, Ambassador Barrère's dispatch from Rome to the French minister of public instruction, though brief, was explicit, and the names of the eminent Italian experts mentioned seemed a sufficient guarantee that it was the original painting. Henry Marcel, director general of the French National Museum, for a moment was inclined to doubt the news, saying:
        'We have so often been cruelly hoaxed that it is only natural that we should feel skeptical that the painting has been found. The telegram which I have read seems so clear and shows such detailed knowledge, however, that it seems to me the news must be true this time. In any case, the theft undoubtedly was the act of a madman. The motive—to avenge thefts committed in Italy by Napoleon—clearly shows this. 'If the experts' examination proves the picture to be authentic, we will restore it to its familiar place and guard it so that theft will be impossible.' The Florentine dealer, Geri, it is believed, will be entitled to claim rewards amounting to 240,000 francs ($48,000) offered by the Society of Friends of the Louvre and Paris newspapers. M. J. T. Homolle, who was director of the Louvre when 'Mona Lisa' was stolen and who was suspended by the French cabinet because of the 
        loss of the painting, was overcome with joy when he learned of its recovery. Seymour de Ricci, an eminent art critic of Paris, declared his faith in the certification of Dr. Corrado Ricci at Florence of the authenticity of the 'Mona Lisa.' 'I do not think there is the slightest doubt,' he said, 'that the painting will be immediately restored to France. 'Italy has no claim whatever on the ""Mona Lisa,"" which was given or sold to the French king, Francis I, by Leonardo da Vinci himself. M. Viviani, minister of public instruction, and M. Jacquier, undersecretary for beaux arts, were both highly elated over the auspicious event, which ushers in their terms of office. The Italian government has advised them that it will deliver over the picture, and they considered the best and safest way of conveying it back to the Louvre. The French government will take the earliest opportunity 
        to express its gratitude to the Italian government for the service it has rendered in recovering the lost treasure. Perugia resided near the St. Louis hospital. He left here hurriedly on Wednesday, saying he was obliged to go to Italy on important business. He is 32 years old, the son of a carpenter. He came to Paris every year during the season and earned about eight francs a day, returning to some village when work was slack. Outside of a few compatriots, humble workers like himself, he was not known to have friends in Paris. A neighbor of Perugia described him as an ordinary workman, having no special technical knowledge and completely ignorant in artistic matters. The neighbor, therefore, was astonished to hear that Perugia was accused of stealing the painting and believed that if the accusation were true, he could only have been acting at the instigation of someone who
         had exploited his patriotic sentiments.

        Safeguarding the Treasures of the Louvre: Police Dogs, Locking Rods, Electric Signals, and Spy Chambers to Stop the Next Man from Quietly Walking Off with an 'Old Master' as Perugia Took 'Mona Lisa. Paris, February 8. The French Government is determined that 'Mona Lisa' shall not be stolen again. Extraordinary precautions have now been taken to prevent this or any other of the treasures of the Louvre from being taken away. One of the first steps taken to safeguard the Louvre was to employ a number of dogs of the clever breed known as police dogs. One of them guards every fifty feet of wall space day and night. No man can now put a hand over the railing in front of the pictures without having a dog after him. The next protective measure was to connect the pictures by a rod so that all those along a certain wall space can be locked up from one lock. Formerly, every picture hung
        separately. Under the new arrangement, each line of pictures hangs upon one flat rod by hooks in the frame, which only admit the rod when it is turned edgewise to the opening in the hook. Then the rod is turned so that the picture cannot be removed from it and is locked in that position. Little chambers have also been constructed behind the carved moldings near the ceiling, from which the guardians of the Louvre can secretly watch every person in the rooms. The knowledge that a hidden guardian is watching them is expected to have a terrifying effect on would-be thieves. The pictures have also been connected by electric wiring. Any tampering with them closes a circuit and causes an electric bell to ring loudly. The return of 'Mona Lisa' has only emphasized the necessity of guarding against similar occurrences in the future. The confession of Vincenzo Perugia has revealed the astonishing
        ease with which he was able to walk away with what is probably the most valuable art treasure in the world. It was on the morning of August 22, 1911, that the world was startled by the announcement that Leonardo da Vinci's great masterpiece had been stolen. Its disappearance from its accustomed place in the Salon Carré, or Square Salon, was noted on August 21. To some reporters who inquired intelligently about its disappearance, the officials on that day explained that it had been taken down to be cleaned. On the following day, the government decided that it was useless to attempt to conceal any longer the fact that it had been stolen. Its value was estimated at $5,000,000. It is interesting to recall some of the extraordinary speculations and theories that were advanced concerning its disappearance. Some argued that it was incredible that a government possession of such incalculable value 
        could be taken by a common thief. They said that some person of great influence, a Cabinet Minister or other high official, had taken the picture to photograph it, had damaged it accidentally, and was keeping it until he could repair it. Another theory was that the mysterious psychological and sex influence of the picture would prove to be the clue to its disappearance. It is well known that this exquisite and subtly fascinating portrait of Mona Lisa del Giocondo exerts a very diverse influence upon the two sexes. Men of impressionable temperament are strongly drawn toward it and feel a deep and even passionate pleasure in the radiations of its 'enigmatical smile.' Women, on the other hand, are, with equal frequency, repelled by it, and are even stirred to hate and fury by the same smile. The partisans of this theory fell into two groups. One group said that a man mentally disordered by 
        the strange fascination of the picture must have stolen it to enjoy its subtle charms in secret. The other group argued that a woman had taken it to vent the rage of her sex upon it. One thing became clear from the mass of theories and interesting facts brought out by the episode. The contents of the Louvre were not, and never had been, well safeguarded. Pictures worth from $1,000,000 to $5,000,000 could have been pulled off their hooks at a favorable moment any day without detection. Officials, moreover, had been in the habit of lending the art treasures to artists and persons of influence. It was stated that 250 pictures had been stolen or 'borrowed' in the course of the nineteenth century. Gradually the months wore on and The recovery of the great picture came to be regarded as hopeless. Then, on December 12, 1913, came the news that it had been found. An art dealer informed the director
        of the Uffizi Gallery at Florence that an Italian workman named Vincenzo Perugia had taken the picture and had it in Florence. This statement was verified and the 'Mona Lisa' returned to France. The confession of Perugia shows that the subtle psychological influence of this picture had, indeed, much to do with his act. Perugia said: 'I am a patriotic Italian. I saw that the Louvre was filled with masterpieces stolen by Napoleon from Italy. I longed to take something back. 'I thought of taking a Raphael, a Titian, a Correggio, and several other masterpieces. But the Mona Lisa seemed to me much more appealing. 'Here she is. I give her back to my country. It is the greatest sacrifice of my life.' From Perugia’s confession, it appeared that he had worked as a painter for a decorating contractor of 280 Rue St. Honoré, Paris. He had worked as a painter on the Louvre for some weeks but gave up this
        work on January 24, 1911. Between this date and August 21, he meditated upon and carried out his plan for stealing the Mona Lisa. It was 7 o'clock in the morning of August 21 when he entered the Louvre. The building was open then for the workmen and guardians or caretakers, but the general public was not admitted that day. Perugia wore the long blouse commonly used by French workingmen, especially by house painters. He looked, of course, like a man working on the building. He walked straight up to the picture in the deserted Salon Carré and took it from the hooks by which it was hung. A man standing on the floor could reach his hand to the top of the small picture. Then he realized that the frame would be heavy and hard to conceal. He quickly removed the picture from the frame. He left the picture lying in the salon and carried the frame to a doorway a few yards away at the head of a small 
        stairway and left it outside the door. Then he returned for the picture. He thrust it under his loose blouse, where it was scarcely noticeable. Hearing footsteps, he decided to leave hurriedly by the small stairway where he had left the frame. As he went out, he put the key in his pocket to prevent anyone from pursuing him that way. Having reached the ground, he crossed the Courtyard of the Sphinx, and then passed out through the gateway known as the Porte Visconti, which faces on the Seine. The French authorities summoned Perugia, together with all the workmen who had worked on the Louvre at the time of or just before the theft. He proved that he had not worked there since January 24, and this seemed sufficient explanation. No one discovered that he was the thief until he revealed it himself.

        THE RESTORED MONA LISA By Frederic J. Haskin. ""More deadly than the male,"" a woman outraged England and made all art lovers weep by hacking the incomparable Rokeby Venus. She did it to get the vote. It recalls the most famous of all art thefts—the stealing of the Mona Lisa by an Italian to avenge the depredations of Napoleon a century old. The complete story of that famous mystery only now may be told with authority. Smiling the same inscrutable smile which the master genius, Leonardo da Vinci, imprisoned upon canvas 400 years ago to the vexation of generations of interpreters, Mona Lisa, mysterious portrait, restored to her admirers after strangely vanishing under the eyes of her guards and eluding the frantic search of a nation of art lovers, again looks down from her place in the Louvre, Paris, the interest of her subtle, mystic expression enhanced by reason of her peculiar adventure.
        Mona Lisa, or, as the Italians call her, La Gioconda, on account of the haunting challenge which the artist divined in the face of his sitter and which he wove into the fabric of his colors, has enthralled and fascinated beholders from the beginning. Many explanatory pages have been written on the meaning of this famous painting, and, provoked by its indefinable charm, its elusive suggestion, many an art student has brought the full power of his critical acumen to the task of finding suitable words for the description of the picture’s strange appeal. Each attempt has failed, and each writer has dwelt with peculiar emphasis upon the qualities of the Mona Lisa smile. This masterpiece is one of the most treasured of the Louvre collection. It has been tentatively valued at more than a million dollars. Painting One of the Most Treasured. It was begun by da Vinci about 1503, when the master 
        stood at the zenith of his fame and power, and, according to Vasari, it took four years of intermittent labor to complete. The woman in whose likeness there was, or into which the artist wrought an intangible something, compelling, unrestful, questioning, in the mind of each who stared back at it, lived in Florence. She was Mona Lisa di Antonio Maria di Noldo Gherardini, a native of Naples, who was married in 1495 to Francesco di Bartolomeo di Zanobi del Giocondo, a prominent citizen of Florence. When she began her sittings for what has since become one of the most renowned of all the world’s portraits, she was probably twenty-five or younger. Da Vinci, painter, poet, engineer, philosopher, and mystic, was fifty-one. Was it an unusual woman that the ripened master painted or was it a forceful symbol coined by his rich, discerning mind? Many times this question has been put to the lady 
        of the superior smile, answered only by the tantalizing glance through the thick, protecting varnish. No wonder, when the loss of their treasure was discovered on the morning of August 21, 1911, a Monday, all Paris was wrought to a frenzy. The news of the theft was received in all parts of the civilized world with the same feelings of dismay. The picture missing from its place in the Salon Carré was the most beautiful from Leonardo’s brush and one of the most precious creations of Western culture. Two Years Pass Without a Clue. Two years and four months passed by without a trace of the vanished work. All efforts of the French police remained fruitless. High rewards offered for the return of the painting went unclaimed, and every clue as to the Whereabouts of the thief ended just without the Louvre gates. As the months sped by while the endeavors of the police proved vain and not even 
        rumors came of a Mona Lisa in foreign lands, all hope that the picture would ever be recovered was given up. It was concluded that the work had been destroyed. The fate of Mona Lisa was put to the account of one of those unintelligible acts of vandalism which go to swell the records of human pathology. Boundless was the enthusiasm, then, which greeted the sudden, unexpected reappearance of the Gioconda Thursday, December 11, 1913, at Florence. In Florence, the original Mona Lisa had sat for a portrait by one of the greatest painters of all time, and in a dingy inn at Florence, the lost painting was found again. The Italian authorities obtained immediate possession of the picture, which was taken in triumphal procession through Italy, under police guard to Rome, to the French ambassador Barrère, and then to Milan, where the director-general of the Louvre, Henry Marcel, and the director 
        of paintings, M. Léprieur, came to take charge of it. The Mona Lisa was again safely housed in Paris last New Year’s Day, and was again hung in its accustomed place at the Louvre, which place had been filled during the time of its loss by Raphael's Castiglione. The theft of this irreplaceable work was an extraordinary one, in that the criminal had been able to penetrate one of the best-guarded treasure houses of Europe and make away with one of its most prized and precious possessions, and disappear with his loot without leaving a single trace behind. The thief was an unusual one, in that for two years and four months he kept his secret, the priceless Mona Lisa hidden away in his garret bedroom in Paris, only in the end to fall into the hands of the criminal authorities through an act of childish carelessness, an almost imbecile simplicity. Immediately, after the discovery of the theft,
        it was thought in Paris that the thief had hidden himself away in the gallery Saturday afternoon, remained in the place all night, and escaped with his spoil Monday morning. The glass casing and the frame of the picture were found leaning against the wall of a narrow stairway leading from the gallery des sept metres, where the old Italian pictures are hung, to the Court of the Sphinx. The door opening from the stairway, part of glass protected by ironwork, was locked, and, at the investigation, Sauvet, one of the workingmen in the Louvre, remembered having opened the door at the request of a person upon whom he came sitting at the bottom of the stairway. He failed to take further notice of this person, other than that he was wearing a blouse similar to those worn by the regular guards. As Monday is cleaning day, and visitors are barred, no suspicion crossed his mind but that the man was
        what he seemed—an official. Here the trail ended. A print of a left thumb upon the abandoned glass frame was all that remained in the way of a clue to the police. Notwithstanding full reports of the matter in L'Illustration, and other papers, nothing more of the criminal was learned. L'Illustration immediately announced that it would pay 40,000 francs, about $8,000, to anyone who would return the picture by September 26, and 45,000 francs—or $9,000—if the picture was brought to them by September 1. It was further announced that no questions would be asked. The editors received some five hundred letters in answer to their announcements, investigated some one hundred cases, and learned nothing. The Museum Club (Amis du Louvre) gave the police 25,000 francs to be used for the obtaining of the painting. The court of investigation convened August 22, and in its hearings the photographed thumb
        print played a leading role. No less than 257 persons were ordered by the court to submit their thumb prints for comparison. Among those furnishing such prints were the directors of the Louvre. The theif of course was not upin the list of those investigated. Vincenzo Peruggia, an Italian, the real despoiler, as established by his own confession and the exact agreement of the fingerprint found upon the glass case with that of his own thumb, when taken into custody by the Italian police, cleared up the murky mystery. He maintained that he entered the Louvre, together with other workmen, Monday morning, made his way unobserved to the Mona Lisa, removed it from its hanging, carried it to the stairway where the frames were found, cut the painting loose from its casing, concealed it in his blouse, and persuaded a passing workman to open the door for him without so much as seeing a guard around. 
        Once outside the Louvre, he proceeded to his lodging house, a nest for a colony of Italian workmen, where he hid the picture and went on with his regular work—that of a house painter and glazier. He continued to ply his trade for more than two years, a thing worth to him a tremendous fortune concealed in the false bottom of his wooden trunk, before trying to dispose of it. Only once was the suspicion of the police directed upon him. But how he escaped that once is another mystery. Peruggia had been employed at the Louvre as a glazier and had been entrusted with the work of framing some of the most costly masterpieces. In October 1911, Prof. Pierre Marcel of the École des Beaux-Arts wrote an open letter to the paper Figaro, suggesting that trace of the criminal was to be sought among the Louvre glaziers. The director of painting took the suggestion, obtained the names of those so employed 
        and formerly so employed, upon which list appeared the name of Peruggia, who, with the rest, was subject to an examination and a house search. The mystery is that the police did not take the fingerprints of these men for comparison, as had been done at the first investigation. Peruggia's downfall came with his attempt to dispose of his spoil. He wrote on November 28, 1913, to Alfred Geri, owner of the Galleria d'Arte e Moderna, at Florence, a dealer in art works, offering, under the name of Leonardi, to sell him the Mona Lisa, which he explained, as a patriotic Italian, he felt ought to be returned to Italy, the land of its production. This plea, strengthened to one of patriotic bitterness that rich Paris should not be decorated with the spoils of Italy robbed during the times of Napoleon, he maintained after his arrest. Geri sought counsel from Prof. Giovanni Poggi, director of the 
        Florence galleries. As a result of his conference, he answered the letter from Paris, entering heartily into the writer's proposals and sentiment, finally arranging a meeting in Italy, which took place at Florence on December 11, when the lost Mona Lisa was drawn from her hiding place under the false trunk bottom and returned to the world after her long seclusion. Nor has the Mona Lisa's smile lost aught of its subtlety.

        ""Mona Lisa"" Thief on Trial. Florence, Italy, June 4.—The trial of Vincenzo Perugia, on the charge of stealing Da Vinci's masterpiece, ""Mona Lisa"" from the Louvre in Paris, began here today. The disappearance of the picture on August 22, 1911, caused a sensation throughout the world, and search for it was not successful until December 12, 1913, when Perugia offered it for sale to a Florentine antiquarian. D. R. Analdi, an alienist, said at today’s hearing that Perugia was only partially responsible for his actions. Perugia did not deny that he had taken ""Mona Lisa"" from the Louvre. He said it was his desire to have it placed in the Palazza Degli Uffizi in Florence. Testimony as to the authenticity of the picture was given by several experts. Other witnesses gave evidence as to the details of the theft.

        MONA LISA'S STORY Return to Paris Recalls Long Misunderstood History. Salomon Reinach, a French Searcher for the Truth, Tells of His Efforts to Learn the Facts of Remarkable Portrait. Paris.—The unprecedented enthusiasm over the return of the Mona Lisa to Paris takes us back to the days of her first arrival, 400 years and more ago. Vincenzo Perugia, the Italian artisan, who abducted her from the Louvre in 1911 to ""give her back"" to Florence, is completely mistaken in his facts. Mona Lisa was always a Paris resident. At the moment when Perugia imagines her to have been ""stolen"" from Italy ""by Napoleon,"" she had not been living in Italy for 300 years. Mona Lisa was brought to Paris by her father, Leonardo da Vinci, who sold her to King Francis I for $40,000 of our money—a terrific price in those days. When first exhibited in the palace of the Louvre 400 years ago there was a rush of all the
        notables of Paris to see her, comparable only to the present ovation of her return. Leonardo was the star guest of the French king, more run after and admired in Paris than in his native Italian city; and he could sell every scrap of his works. In his baggage when he came to France he brought the Mona Lisa. ""Why does she smile so sadly?"" asked the French king. Leonardo never told him. Yet he knew why. Why does Mona Lisa smile so sadly? Here at last is her true pathetic history. Now is the time to tell it. Mona Lisa has too long been misunderstood. ""During 400 years past,"" says Paul Leprieur, curator of the Louvre paintings, who went to Italy and brought her back, ""during 400 years past Mona Lisa has addled the wits of those who have talked about her after having looked too long upon her.”“Four centuries is rather much,” replies Salomon Reinach. This Salomon Reinach is the very type of the
        exact archaeologist. He will not permit geniuses to create facts, and is the enemy of wind and flapdoodle, breaking in on lofty theories with a marriage or death certificate. He is curator of the St. Germain museum, a remarkably distinguished man, perfectly well known in America. And Salomon Reinach pricked the bubble of all this wind about Mona Lisa. Leonardo da Vinci took four years (1501–1504) to paint the wife of his friend, Francesco del Giocondo; and, so far from being in love with her or she with him, he dropped both portrait and sitter again and again, on a moment’s notice, to go on pleasure or business trips. Reinach is a terrible man. He chases a date through a hundred manuscripts until he traces it. Leonardo quit Florence in 1499, to return only in 1501. In 1502 he traveled in Umbria as architect of Valentine Borgia. He returned to Florence in 1503, went on a pleasure jaunt to 
        Venice in 1505, returned, and went to Milan in 1506. That is not four years of loving contemplation, is it? The truth is, that Leonardo painted the portrait gratis for his friend, the husband dropping in when business called. It bears every mark of such a non-paid, purely friendship portrait—to the last, in which the painter sells it to a third party. Salomon Reinach has found it. We know the melancholy of Mona Lisa. Married in 1496, she had no children until 1499. Then came a little daughter. Salomon Reinach remembered that once a librarian of Florence communicated to Muntz, the great French art historian, an extract from the ancient Libre del Morti—records of deaths in Florence. By this, it appears that on June 1, 1501, the little daughter (fanciulla) of Francesco del Giocondo and his wife Mona Lisa was buried from the church of Santa Maria Novella. Why, the very costume of Mona Lisa in the picture is heavy mourning! You see
        now. Her smile is a constrained smile, the best she can do to please the kindly painter who has paid singers, musicians, and buffoons to entertain her.

                no one in all the world who will
                do as much for you as will your
                mother. When every one else has
                forsaken you and you haven't a
                friend on earth, your mother will
                stand by you with words of en
                couragement and love.
                See if you can't make her to
                morrow a very pleasant one in
                deed.
                The white carnation has been
                chosen as the flower symbolical
                of filial devotion and the florists
                are crowding their windows with
                the beautiful emblems of purity
                and love, for everyone's going to
                make a big bow to mother tomor
                row.
                Don't forget to wear a white
                carnation and wish mother the
                happiest returns of the day."

                ""White flower for Mother dead
                Bright flower for Mother living
                It was five years ago that Miss An-
                na Jarvis, of Philadelphia, con-
                ceived the idea of selecting one day
                of the year upon which the devotion
                to mothers' memory should be ob-
                served, and the second Sunday in
                May being the day upon which fell
                the anniversary of her mother's
                death, that day was chosen by her as
                Mothers' day.
                Miss Jarvis wrote to churches, so-
                cieties, public officials, noted people
                and the press and all joined in the
                movement which she had originated
                It has spread so rapidly that this
                year a majority of the governors of
                states have issued proclamations set-
                ting aside tomorrow as Mothers' day
                and suggesting that it be made one of
                the state's memorial days.
                The original plan was that each
                one wishing to honor his mother
                would wear a white carnation, but
                the demand proving greater than the
                supply, it was decided to wear a
                white carnation for the dead and a
                bright flower for the living So wear
                a flower tomorrow, white or bright,
                ""in honor of the best mother in the
                world, your mother.""
                The Nymore Road.
                At the railroad and warehouse com-
                mission hearing yesterday at Nymore,
                one fact stood out with startling dis-
                tinctness ^Every witness examined
                for Nymore testified that because of
                the j?oad between Nymore and Be-
                midji, loads coming to Bemidjl from
                IMHk Wl
                the country south and east of Ny-
                more had to be cut in two at Nymore
                and two trips made to coVer the last
                mile
                It is because of this condition,
                more than any other, that the people
                of Nymore are asking the commission
                to order a depot or depots built by
                the railroads A depot at Nymore
                will be a body blow to Bemidjl, as
                it will cut oft a tonnage revenue of
                about $10,000 a year, but if the com-
                mission orders one, Bemidji has only
                itself to blame The road should
                have been put in hist class shape
                long ago as it is one of the main
                traffic arteries to this city
                Foitunately for Bemidjl, the com-
                mission was taken to Nymore over
                the railroad tracks If it had been
                en over the road itself, it might
                have given a decision on the spot
                At any rate, whether or not the depot
                is ordered, the road should be put in
                first-class shape at once
                The Commercial club committee on
                highways was instructed last Tues-
                day night to prepare figures on the
                cost of paving the Nymore road
                These, with figures on the cost of
                making a sand or macadam road, are
                to be presented to the city council at
                its next meeting For several years
                past $150 to $200 per year has been
                spent on this road and it is nof much
                better today than when Chief Bemid*
                ji lived on the lake shore
                Not only the people at Nymore are
                asking for this depot, but the farmers
                living out in that country who have
                to use this road want better shipping
                facilities A paved street from Be-
                midji to Nymore would remedy the
                condition and remove a good cause
                for complaint

                LONDON, May 7. The woman's suf
                frago bill was rejected last night by the
                house of lords by a vote of 1M to 60.
                Speeches in favor of tho bill were
                made by Baron Courtney, of Penwlth.
                the Earl of Lytton. and Baron Wll
                loughby de Broke, whllo Baron Wear-,
                dale, the Marquis of Crowe, and Vis
                count St. Aldwyn spoke against It.
                Viscount St Aldwyn said the argu
                ments for the extension of tho parlia
                mentary suffrage to women, which were
                based on the results obtained in those
                States of the United States where it had
                been' tried, did not apply in the United
                Kingdom, because in those States men
                were In the majority, while In the Brit
                ish Isles they were in the minority.
                Consequently, ho argued, the granting
                of the parliamentary vote to women In
                the British Isles would mean the hand
                ing over the destinies of tho country
                and of the empire to a female elec
                torate, which, he said, was a perilous
                step to take.
                Among those who voted for the bill
                were Viscount Money, of Blackburn:
                the Archbishop of Canterbury, and the
                Bishops of London, Hereford, Bangor,
                and St. Asaph.

                Older Tlian Christianity
                Tho celebration of Mothers' Day,
                while new to us as a feast day, Is In
                history older than Christianity Itself,
                for Mother-worship with its rites and
                ceremonies dates back to tho days of
                the pagans when Cybele, tho Groat
                Mother of Gods, was idealized in
                Greece two centuries or more before
                tho coming of Christ. Later tho day
                111 HHHHHmBHSW'
                became known as tho festival of Hll
                arla and was hold on the Ides of
                March. As was tho custom of tho
                day, offerings wore made at tho tem
                ple."" With tho advent of Christianity
                the festival was changed, and although
                It still Included many pagan customs,
                It becamo a celebration"" In honor of
                Mother Church and was held on Mid
                Lent Sunday, or tho fourth Sunday In
                Lent On this day tho faithful came
                to bring offerings to Mother Church.
                Finally, tho day took tho name of
                Mothering Sunday, and was sot aside
                as-tho time when peoplo should pay
                visits to their paronts, especially to
                tholr mothers, also that they should
                carry with them some cako or trinket.
                ""Going a-mothcrlng"" soon becamo tho
                fashion and a certain kind of cako
                known as simncl cako was carried as
                a gift to tho mothor. Horrick, tho
                poet, In addressing one of tho char
                actors of his poem on Mothering,
                says:
                ""I'll to thee a slmnel bring
                Gainst thou go a-mothering,
                So that when sho blessos theo,
                Half that blessing thou'lt give me.""
                This proves that even In tho early
                days tho mothers' blosslng was highly
                regarded.
                In England tho slmnel cake3 woro
                composed of a crust made of flno flour
                and water with sufficient saffron to
                give it a deop yellow color and the
                interior filled with such ingredients
                as Is used In plum puddings. They
                aro boiled and brushed over with egg
                and set away to harden. When they
                are to bo used they must bo robaked
                and softened. This, custom was In
                vogue during tho seventeenth century
                when every child who resided away
                from homo was expected to carry a
                slmnel to his or her mothor. Fre
                quently tho cakes wero kept until
                Easter -and sorved ns tho desert for
                the dinner on that day.
                Early Celebrations
                Mothers' Day was first observed in
                1908 In Philadelphia by Bevoral of
                tho Sunday schoolB, and in 1909 about
                two thousand people took part In tho
                services. Seattle, Washington, how
                over, has tho honor of being tho real
                pioneer In a genuino Mothers' Day
                celebration. This was In 1900 when
                hundrods of peoplo gathered in tho
                churches of that city on tho second
                Sunday In May. They carried bou
                quets and wreaths of flowers and at
                the closo of sermons on ""Mothor
                Lovo"" tho entire congregations hold
                tholr flowors aloft whllo tho pastor
                pronounced a blessing, and at the
                closo of tho service tho flowers were
                gathered together and placed on the
                graves of mothers whoso relatives
                wero not in tho city to perform this
                loving service.
                In 1910 tho Governor of tho State
                of Washington set asldo tho eighth
                of May ot that year as Mothers' Day
                for that Stato, and over slnco that tlmo
                tho proclamation of Mothers' Day has
                been issued with tho samo regularity
                as that of Thanksgiving. A request
                is also added that each person wear
                a whlto flower on tho day and that
                special services should bo held in tho
                churches.
                Tho Stato of Oklahoma was the next
                to fall in lino wltha Mothers' Day
                proclamation, whon Governor Leo
                Cruco in 1912 paid such a glowing
                tribute to motherhood in his procla
                mation to tho peoplo of that Stato:
                ""Each citizen, whether old or
                young, rich or poor, happy or -sorrowful,
                remember her whoso
                lovo passeth human understand
                ing, and remembering, manifest
                to tho world your lovo nnd gratl
                tudo by wearing a carnation In
                honor of tho dearest of all moth
                ers, and wearing It, think of her
                and love her.""
                Slnco that tlmo many Slatos have
                followed the example of these two.
                Western States, and at present tho day
                has takon-'H prdrrfihent plnfo among
                our feast days. Sermons aro preached
                on tho subject of motherhood in the
                majority of our churches. Tho Sun
                day schools have a Mothors Day ser
                vice, and In tho afternoon many go
                out to tho cemotories to cover tho
                gravo of ""man's best friend"" with gar
                lands of flowors.
                Mothers' Pensions
                Tho celebration of Mothers' Day
                has brought about a stronger feeling
                on tho subject of pensioning mothers,
                and ono Is surprised to learn how
                many States havo already adopted tho
                pensioning system for mothors who
                aro too poor to properly caro for their
                chlldron. Whllo the plan is too now
                to show vory many benefits to tho

                a homo is less likely to turn criminal

                Mother Influence on Statesmen
                Tho significance of Mothers' Day
                should find an echo in every heart,
                for It was tho mothors of our Statos-
                Imen who Jn the early days put our
                'Nation on a 'firm foundation ""The
                hand that rocks the cradlo Is the hand I
                that rules tho world."" It was tho
                mother of Georgo Washington who,
                by hor woman's intuition that ho was
                mado for better things, saved him
                from becoming a midshipman on a
                British ship. It was the turning
                point in tho life of tho Father of his
                Country whon rather than causo his
                mother sorrow ho roturnod his middy
                uniform and said ""Mothor I can never
                go and cause you so much grief. I
                will stay at homo."" With Washing
                ton In tho British Navy thero might
                have been no Monmouth and no York
                town. Tho character of Androw Jackson's
                mother stands out in Amorlcan his

                sky of those early days in tho moun
                tains. Her advice to her son Bhows
                the wisdom of Polonlus and may well
                bo treasured by tho man who desires
                to succood. Jackson never forgot hor
                words of advice and a short time be
                fore his death he repeated her part
                ing advice to a young man in whom
                ho was interested."

                Every man and woman
                blessed with a good
                mother knows it's true
                and knows why it's true.
                It doesn't take a very
                old child to understand,
                either.
                But, since human nature is human
                nature, every day isn't observed as
                Mother's Day. There is all the more
                reason, therefore, for observing the
                second Sunday in May May 14, this
                year with a real celebration. Some
                one has tried to figure out a real cele
                bration after this fashion for sons:
                Wear a flower in mother's honor
                a white one if mother is dead; a col
                ored flower for a living mother.
                Send mother a box of spring flowers.
                Write her a letter a long one.
                Give mother a whole day of your
                time for that ""good visit"" she longs
                for.
                Send mother your picture, and snap
                shots of your home, your children,
                your work.
                Tell mother, your plans and ambi
                tions she made them possible.
                Tell mother your smaller troubles
                she wants to help you.
                Thank mother for her care and her
                teachings tell her how they have
                helped you.
                Don't forget that mother still likes
                candy.
                Mother was your first and truest
                sweetheart don't forget to say ""I
                love you I""
                For the daughters these things are
                suggested
                It's your chance to say ""thank you""
                to your best friend your mother.
                Be sure to celebrate by wearing a
                flower for mother: White for mothers
                not living; colored flowers for mother
                still with you.
                Send mother some gay spring flow
                ers, a brilliant bouquet or a thrifty
                plant.
                Make a dainty cap or a ""dress-up""
                gown or shirtwaist as a love gift to
                mother.
                If mother is far away, send her a
                ""special delivery letter"" for her Sun
                day treat.
                Send mother the book you just en
                Joyed reading.
                Don't forget to send her pictures of
                yourself, your friends and your good
                times.
                Tell mother your small joys and sor
                rows and ask her advice It will be
                good.
                Ask mother to tell you about her
                girlhood you'll both enjoy it.
                Mother is a gin too. She likes pretty
                things, love, laughter and compliments.
                Give her some.
                The spirit of this celebration is
                right enough. The letter of it fails.
                Nobody can tell you how to observe
                Mother's Day.. You know. If she's a
                red carnation mother make her happy.
                If she's a white carnation mother, do
                something that would make her happy
                if she were a red carnation mother.
                Nobody can draw up a celebration
                schedule for Mother's Day. How can
                one, when nobody can find adequate
                words to write about Mother's Day?
                Mother's Day is something new In
                the way of holidays not like Christ
                mas and Easter which are old, old
                holidays. And It's new, compared with
                the Fourth of July. In fact, It's just
                about the newest holiday we have.
                It was no longer ago than 1906 that
                Miss Anne Jarvis of Philadelphia, hon
                oring the memory of her own mother
                on the anniversary of her death, con
                ceived of a day of which everyone
                should do reverence to his mother,
                whether living or dead. The World's
                Sunday School association adopted the
                plan, and, in the next few years, an
                nually designated one Sunday as
                Mother's Day. The purposes of this
                celebration, as stated by Dr. George
                W. Bailey, then president of the asso
                ciation, were:
                ""To recall the memories of the
                mothers that are gone, and through
                loving words and loving care to
                brighten the lives of the mothers that
                remain, and to help children, men and
                women to a greater blessing in honor
                ing their fathers and their mothers.
                ""To recall mother's prayers, moth
                er's dying words, and the promises
                made to mother by the big boy that
                still mourns her, and to stop and think
                a little of what she was in her life to
                her family.""
                In 1908 Miss Jarvis founded an or
                ganization now known as Mother's Day
                International association.
                The idea was taken up by the states.
                In 1910 the governor of Washington
                Issued a proclamation designating
                May 8 of that year as ""Mother's Day""
                and urged It be celebrated by special
                services and the wearing of a white
                flower in honor of all mothers. In 1912
                the governor of Oklahoma issued a
                similar proclamation.
                National recognition was given
                Mother's Day by resolution of the
                Sixty-third congress, approved by the
                President of the United States on May
                8, 1914, designating that the second
                Sunday in May thereafter should gen
                erally be known as ""Mother's Day,""
                and directing that it should be the
                duty, of the President to request its ob
                servance by Issuing a proclamation
                calling upon the government officials
                to display the United States flag on
                all government buildings, and the peo
                ple to display the flag at their homes
                or other suitable places on this day,
                ""as a public expression of our love
                and reverence for the mothers of our
                country.""
                Originally the white carnation was
                the flower worn in observance of the
                day. Then, the public settled on white
                carnations for mothers dead and ted
                carnations for mothers living; then on
                white flowers and colored flowers.
                Now the tendency is to wear ""mother's
                favorite flower.""
                The great of the world have been
                proud to pay tribute to mothers.
                Unhappy is the man for whom his
                own mother has not made all other
                mothers venerable. Rlchter.
                A man never sees all that his mother
                has been to him till it's too late to
                let her know that he sees it. W. D.
                Howells.
                If you would reform the world from
                its errors and vices, begin by enlisting
                the mothers. C. Simmons.
                I think It must somewhere be writ
                ten that the virtues of the mothers
                shall be visited on their children, as
                well as the sins of the fathers.
                Charles Dickens.
                The loving sacrifices of motherhood
                must burn on the altar of undying
                faith. If I could bequeath but one
                priceless heritage to youth, it would
                be the ability to know the full measure
                of her love. Her Influence is the most
                changeless thing in the fiber of a
                man's character. It outweighs arts,
                science, literature and philosophy, for
                her faith and works are better than
                all the wise man's knowledge. Sena

           THE VELOCIPEDE. “Nothing is at once invented and perfected,” says an old Latin maxim, the truth of whose application was made manifest in the early history of the velocipede. Like all things on earth it was forty years in the wilderness. It first made its appearance in Paris and received notice of the following effect in the Courier de Paris. The date of the extract was July 25, 1789: “It was stated that a certain vehicle, invented by M. M. Blanchard and Massaurier—the former the celebrated aeronaut—was exhibited in rapid motion in the Place Louis XII. on July 27, 1789, in presence of many members of the French academy and a large concourse of spectators. At the front of the machine was the head of an eagle with outspread wings, to which was attached the apparatus with which the driver directed its movements. Behind him was seated an individual who gave an impetus, more or less rapid, to the machine by pressing his feet alternately on the ground. He sat down or stood at discretion, with his legs half concealed in a sort of box, where the springs that communicated
           movement to the machine were evidently placed. The vehicle was subsequently transported to Versailles, and exhibited its capabilities in presence of Louis XVI, Maria Antoinette and their court. There is nothing to show why this experiment failed, but it is to be supposed that it had its defects.” The second appearance was also in 1808, and public exhibitions were made of its workings in the Jardin du Luxembourg, but without success. At that time it was mounted on very low wheels, and the rider had to support himself by placing his feet directly on the ground. Such a mechanism was of course rudimentary, and the result was that the invention was extensively ridiculed and caricatured, and in these archives only do any traces of the first experiments made with this machine in the garden of Luxembourg exist. But the modern railroad locomotive was also sneered at and caricatured, and so was the modern steamboat. And the early inventors, who sought to make the world wiser, were called disciples of the black art, and friends of the devil. And more, they were socially 
           ostracized; they were hooted at and stoned by the mob, and sometimes burned at the stake. But they never ceased scheming and planning, nor was the velocipede to stop here. Twenty years after its first exhibition the velocipede reappeared in Paris. This time, a public functionary, one M. Dreuze, perfected the machine of twenty years before, and again exhibited it in its improved form. M. Dreuze secured the rider’s point of support upon the axletrees to the two wheels instead of the ground, and thus created the actual modern velocipede. The inventor, who belonged to the administration of postoffices, also formed the further idea of proposing this machine for the use of rural postmen, as being of greater availability in the matter of speed and promptness, and at the same time causing them less The plan was adopted, but unfortunately, just in the winter season, when many difficulties existed in the way of locomotion. The wheels slipped about in the mud, and plans were frustrated, and the enterprise was again considered a failure. At this late date, it would have 
           been suggested that it was only necessary to iron the wheels or suspend the use of the velocipede during the winter; but the French Government lacks invention and dropped the velocipede. “Three times and out,” is the old saying, but not so with our subject. A few years on, and, undiscouraged, the velocipede appeared a third time, and again in an altered form—this time being a little carriage upon three wheels and propelled by the hands of the rider. This machine did not succeed on account of the difficulty in guiding it and the fatigue it caused the guider. It is a well-known fact that the muscles of the legs can be used much longer than those of the arms, and, acting upon this hint, all good velocipedes are so arranged that the action of the arms is merely complimentary to that of the legs. This failure was the result of not attending to this fact. “The mills of the gods grind slowly, but they grind exceedingly fine.” Science and improvement move like the tortoise, but still, they move, as Galileo said of the world. When a pebble is dropped in the water your 
           eye loses the ripple. But that little splash has displaced every drop in the stream, and the water you see before you has been completely changed. The velocipede as it has been exhibited thus far was an idea dropped into the mud, and that idea must grow, and the mind must be revolutionized before its work ends. In the presence of success who is so bold as to laugh. Ridicule falls harmless before the iron armor of prosperity. And the velocipede succeeded. Paris, where it was hooted at and frowned down, now lifts up the prostrate work, and the thing despised yesterday is the idol worshipped to-day. It is the poetry of justice, and the two share the triumph. The thoroughfares of Paris are thronged with countless riders on the strange creature, and the public have warned the velocipede votaries that they must carry their lanterns on their vehicles to avoid accidents. The mania has spread to all classes, and to the suburban cities of the capital. In St. Cloud, Vincennes, Engheim, Pantim; in Bordeaux, Marseilles, and the other principal cities, the people are all 
           riding this economical species of iron horse, which requires no feed, harness, stable, or groom to care for it. The velocipede and velocipede mania has reached America. It struck New Orleans many years ago. But the inhabitants of that benighted burg thought it might be the ""yellow jack"" in disguise, and gave it the cold shoulder. Time passed, and all Europe was ablaze with enthusiasm and astride of their favorite Philadelphia, stand and quakerish, has adopted the velocipede with but little less enthusiasm than New York. Jersey is practicing, and so are the swells and the broadcloth fractions of the rectangular city bid fair to rival New York in their exhibition of the new order of equestrianism. Chicago, as in all things, rides velocipedes are becoming a matter of every day occurrence on our streets. Our tradesmen and mechanics are beginning to lay them in for sale. The fever is catching, by the time the season opens we will see them coming among our regular institutions. If they are to prove a success, there is no city and surrounding country better adapted 
           for them than this is; a city perfectly flat, and a surrounding country equally flat, are elements for the use of this machine best calculated to test its merits. Chicago, as is her wont, is not to be beaten even in velocipedes, and comes to the rescue with a machine which differs from any other extant, not only in its general appearance, but in its motive power. This Chicago velocipede has three wheels, two behind and one in front. The hind wheels are considerably the largest, being four feet and two inches in diameter, while the front wheel is only two feet and one-half. The front wheel is for the purpose of guiding the machine, and is connected by a lever with the body, and reaching within convenient distance of the seat, a straddle runs up from the axle of the front or guiding wheel, about a foot from the tire, which surmounted by a lamp. This velocipede is propelled by spring-power, which works as follows: On the axle of the hind wheels is fastened a pinion, which is operated upon by a cog wheel, five times its size in diameter. Fastened to each side of 
           this large cog-wheel is a dog, which works into a ratchet, upon the hub of which ratchet is fastened the center of the springs. The other end of the spring is fastened to a rod of iron, which runs through the body of the velocipede. These springs are made of the very best English spring steel, two inches wide, one-tenth of an inch thick, and nine feet long, and when wound up their power is estimated at over 3,000 pounds each. Immediately outside of the spring, and in the ratchet hub, is fastened one of the treadles. The large cog-wheel and ratchet work loose around the shaft on which they are placed. The treadles are two feet long, and reach from the ratchet shaft to within convenient distance for the foot of a person occupying the seat. On the end of each treadle is a slipper to keep the foot from being shoved forward. By an ingenious contrivance the wheels can be thrown out of gear, so that the velocipede, even under full headway, can be turned around within a space of fourteen feet. The seat has the appearance and general characteristics of a buggy seat, 
           and can carry two persons with ease. It was designed for the use of ladies only, but can be used by anybody. The grand feature of this Chicago velocipede is, that it is worked by spring power, and that the springs can be perpetually wound up by simply using the treadles after ately. It only takes one-fourth the power to wind the springs that the springs exert in unwinding. By pressing upon the treadle with the foot the ratchet is turned, on which is placed the spring, which of course is thereby wound. It differs from the Alton invention in this, that the springs are being continuously wound by the alternate treadles, and this can always be kept in motion; while the Alton invention runs only a mile and then stops to be wound again. This Chicago invention has been tested and all who have seen it are sanguine of its success. The cost of one of these machines will be about $100. Velocipedes are of various kinds. Some have two, and others three, and even four wheels; all have either pedals or rests on which to place the feet, and usually either brakes or levers to 
           regulate the speed.THE TWO-WHEEL VELOCIPEDES. The two wheeled velocipedes, or the bicycles as they are styled, are intended for the male sex only, and are by far the swiftest machines. They are usually of wrought iron, and have pedals or reels attached to the front and large wheel, and the working of these gives a light movement of the feet and the requisite impulse to the vehicle. The saddle is placed upon a bar of iron, suspended four inches above the top of the fore wheel. The hands rest on a handle in front of the machine, which, working on a pivot, serves as a balancing pole, and equilibrium is preserved by exercising a slight twist to this handle. By this means the rider stops the revolving motion of THE THREE-WHEEL VELOCIPEDES. The three-wheel velocipede, or tricycle, is easier to guide and safer to use than the bicycle. Its speed, however, is less rapid; still, it can be made to pass a carriage at full trot. As the fair sex largely patronize the tricycle, the seat is more commodious than that of the bicycle, having sides and backs of wicker, and a horse 
           hair cushion to sit upon. The hind wheels, though large, are light, and revolve with facility. The fore wheel, which is smaller, serves to guide the machine, being acted upon by means of the handle, which causes it instantly to turn in the direction indicated by the rider. The pedals are shaped like slippers, which facilitate the movement of the legs, and at the same time admit of the foot being disengaged instantaneously. The movement required to impel the machine is a perfectly natural one, analogous to that of walking. That is, it requires but the slightest pressure of the foot, and produces no unusual fatigue to the leg. In addition to these advantages, the largest three-wheeled velocipedes have carriers attached to the pedals and fit on the axles. By this means the speed of the vehicle is considerably increased, and the pressure of the foot is relieved by transmitting the motion to the driving apparatus of the machine by means of impulse and a brake.

            ROGER MOTORCYCLE. It Left New York Yesterday on Its Journey to Chicago. NEW YORK, Nov. 15.—At 12:15 o’clock today the new Roger motorcycle left on its 900-mile journey to Chicago. The motorcycle is the same as the horseless carriage, which has caused so much interest all over the country. This is the longest trip that has ever been attempted by a motorcycle in this country. The carriage in which the trip is being made is patterned after the phaeton and is run by the Benz naphtha motor. The carriage has no baggage other than the two men who are attending to it and forty gallons of naphtha. The carriage will run during the daylight hours, and at night the travelers will rest wherever darkness overtakes them. It is expected that the carriage will reach Chicago next Saturday evening.

            SPORTS AND RECREATION THE WORLD OF SPORTS. POLO—CHESS—ATHLETICS. R. G. Betts’s Services to Motorcycling—The Kennel Show. One of the most active workers among motorcyclists is R. G. Betts, the president of the Federation of American Motorcyclists. Mr. Betts was recently elected to this office. The purpose of the organization is to ""encourage the use of motorcycles and to promote the general interests of motorcycling; to ascertain, defend, and protect the rights of motorcyclists; to facilitate touring; to assist in the good roads movement and to advise and assist in the regulation of motorcycle racing and other competitions in which motorcycles engage."" He became interested in motorcycles while living in Boston in 1900, his first experience gained on a rented tricycle. In August of that
            year he sought to organize the first motorcycle club, and issued a call to bring together some fourteen interested men. The group, away from its stated purpose, and, against Mr. Betts’s protest, resolved itself into a national organization styled the Associated Motorcyclists. Mr. Betts is a native of New York and has been connected with bicycle journals for many years. He is now the editor of the motor and motorcycle publications published by the Goodwin Company. He is a member of the New York Motorcycle Club and the Alpha Motorcycle Club and was one of the founders of the Metropolitan Cycling Club. He is also a delegate of the Associated Cycling Clubs. There is much interest in the Election Day races to be held at the Meadow Brook Club, on the Hempstead Plains. There will be five races,
            gentlemen riders competing. Some of the best steeplechase horses owned at the Meadow Brook and Rockaway hunts, the Great Neck Club, the Genesee Hunt and the Country Club of Westchester will enter. “Larry” Waterbury, the poloist, will ride some of the Gould entries, and Rene La Montagne are expected to carry the colors of Harry Payne Whitney. A steeplechase entry of August Belmont’s son, August Belmont, Jr., will have the pick of the horses.

            MOTORCYCLES FOR POLICE. Machines Now Being ""Tried Out"" for Selection for a Squad. Through certain motorcycle riders and dealers it is reported that New York, or at least Manhattan borough, is to have a motorcycle police squad. Inspector Smith, it is said, has become a convert to the idea ever since the general adoption, about a year ago, of the ""grip control,"" which enables a rider to start and stop and regulate his speed on one of the power cycles with one hand and without removing it from the steering bar. A number of members of the New York Motorcycle Club and several dealers have been interviewed by the inspector, with a view to selecting the best make of machine, and several varieties have been tried out on the road by officers. Two patrolmen are now covering posts on motorcycles, 
            Patrolman Ennis, on Riverside Drive, being one of them. According to Inspector Smith the only thing that stands in the way of an immediate formation of a motorcycle squad is lack of funds. He considers the machines necessary for chasing automobiles and runaways, and he hopes to be able to get the money for them before long.

Derkum on Thor Reeled Off Miles Close to 56 Seconds Yesterday, in Tryouts—Breeze Goes in 58 on Indian. BY FREDERIC PABST World's records will be shattered at Agricultural Park this afternoon when the crack motorcyclists of the west meet in fourteen different events. The speedy little two-wheelers have been tuned up to the second and will be out today to cut down existing records, and judging from the time made yesterday the fastest miles ever seen on a local track will result. All of the events are well filled and much interest is being shown in the races. The following is the program of events: Race No. 1—Five miles, fully equipped stock machines, single cylinder, 
        under 50 cu. in. Prize, $30, $15, $5 in merchandise. Race No. 2—Five miles, fully equipped stock machines, twin cylinder, under 60 cu. in. Prize, $30, $15, $5 in merchandise.

Race No. 14—One hour race, free for all. Prize, beautiful cup. The track was alive with speeding machines yesterday and the trials went off without an accident of any kind. A force of police kept the people off the course to prevent a repetition of the unfortunate 
        occurrence of the day previous. The fastest work yesterday was done by Paul Derkum on a “Thor.” He went close to 56 seconds for the mile, and says he will reach that mark in the contest today. Ben Brees did some fast riding on an Indian. He went around the circle in 58 seconds. Others who went close to the minute mark were John Derkum, W. Hose and G. Blaylock, these latter on single cylinder machines. The track is in the best of shape and there is every reason to expect the fastest time. Jake De Rosier, the well-known Indian rider, will not appear. He was talked of on all sides as Derkum’s one opponent to be feared, but he has not been entered, and C.W. Risden, the local Indian agent, says he never expected him to be here for the contests. The statement that De Rosier would race here was unauthorized, according to Risden.
        Risden said last night that his fastest Indian machine was put out of commission in the tryouts Monday. Brees had gone to the track without sufficient oil, and a piston stuck, putting the car out of the running. There are fifteen entries in the five-mile free-for-all for one-cylinder machines. Four Thors, a Merkel, three Indians, two Reading Standards, two Ives, and H-D's, a Harley Davidson and Peugeot will do battle. All the crack riders are entered to ride, including Derkum, Wilson, Hoag, Knapp, Richardson and Seymour. The one-hour race will be a hummer. Twenty-one are named to go, and the skill of the riders and the stamina of the machines will be thoroughly tested.

       The Motorcycle on the Farm. If one is to believe the statements of the leading motorcycle manufacturers of the day and their statements seem logical, it is cheaper to make a trip to town on a motorcycle than to drive or walk. A manufacturer of one of these motorcycles (his particular make holds the world's record for economy) states that while the machine that made the world's record traveling fifty miles at a cost of less than one-tenth cent per mile over country roads was operated by an expert, it is nothing unusual for this particular make of motorcycle in the hands of an amateur to travel from six to eight miles on one cent's worth of gasoline. In comparison with the private riding horse the expense per mile is naturally much less and if one figures that while the driving horse must be fed daily, the motorcycle only 
       consumes while in use, the difference is still greater. The limit of a horse for continuous daily driving is probably thirty miles, while that of a motorcycle is over two hundred. Good traveling for a horse means four miles an hour; good traveling for a motorcycle, twenty miles a motorcycle from thirty to fifty miles per hour. In this age of scarce hired help, time, at some season is extremely valuable to the farmer. His ability to cover the distance to town and back with a motorcycle in one fifth of the road driving horse time and with no time wasted harnessing and unharnessing, is a factor to be considered. Most all the good motorcycles are now equipped with tandem attachments and luggage carriers, if desired. By means of this tandem attachment two can ride as well as one. The luggage carrier permits the carrying of 
       small freight, not exceeding 200 pounds. Many a farmer, as well as his children, have rebelled at their inability to go to town, to the swimming hole or the fishing grounds in the late summer evening, for a horse cannot be worked all day and be driven on the road at night. To these the motorcycle fills a long felt want. It is ever ready, costs nothing when idle and will last for years. It is really more expensive to be without a motorcycle than to own one, just as it is more expensive to plow with a hand plow, cradle the grain and use the flail instead of the modern appliances. The best makes of motorcycle today can be had for from $225 up. A motorcycle like many other pieces of machinery, can be built too cheaply to be good. There are, however, several well-established makes, which have years of successful manufacture
       behind them and one will not go amiss in choosing any of these. The motorcycle of today has come to stay. Already in the cities it is being adopted extensively by business firms because of the great time-saving its use assures. Repair men, inspection men, etc., can accomplish triple the work possible with their former horse and carriage. The saving of time as well as the great pleasure to be derived from its use has given the motorcycle a lasting place in the home of the American farmer.

       MOTOR CYCLES INVADE ALL FIELDS OF ACTIVITY. Preacher, Doctor, Policeman and Soldier Now Use Two-Wheeled Vehicles. Hundreds of daily demonstrations are proof of the utility, speed, and economy of the modern motor cycle. There is scarcely a field of activity that the two-wheeler has not entered and proved its value. The motor cycle carries the minister to reach his patient in less time than ever before, making it possible to eliminate many hours of human suffering. The motor cycle carried the minister of the gospel on his missions of mercy. The motor cycle is a part of every progressive police department, carrying mounted officers to the scene of crime or accident, and enabling them to run down violators of the law. The motor cycle aids the forest ranger in protecting our great timber lands from fire. The motor cycle 
       carries mail and delivers telegrams. The motor cycle rushes the important prescription to the bedside of the suffering. The motor cycle hurries the pulmotor to the beach, where every second counts, in the effort to restore life. A motor cycle mounted guard accompanies the President of the United States in his trips about the capital. Motor Cycle in War. Uses of the motor cycle in the army are almost unlimited. Motor cycle dispatch riders and scouts have won great fame for themselves in the present European struggle. Machine guns mounted on motor cycles are carried to their positions on the battlefield; motor cycles with side-cars hurry supplies to the Red Cross workers who are seeking to relieve the injured soldiers to the hospitals. ""The motor cycle has revolutionized signaling on the battlefield,"" says Henry Beach 
       Needham, a war correspondent. It has practically done away with wig-wagging on the field. It is economical, efficient, and speedy; it is everywhere and nowhere as much as the front. For pleasure too, the motor cycle has made a definite place for itself. The ease with which the two-wheeler is operated, its reliability, and comfort make it an ideal vehicle for touring. Club sociability and endurance runs are enjoyed by thousands of riders all over the country every year. And more and more we hear of the long-distance tourist, riding from ocean to ocean, from gulf to lake, around the United States or circling the globe—for pleasure. Many of these long-distance tourists are women, who find as much pleasure in the sport as do the men. King ""Eight"" Car Arrives. The new 1915 eight-cylinder King touring car arrived last night, 
       and will be placed on exhibition at the local salesroom of William P. Barnhart & Co., 1712 14th street northwest.

       Billings Motorcycle Club Has Thrived Since 1913. Throughout most of the years since 1913 Billings has had an active motorcycle club. In those 27 years the city has watched [motorcycling] grow from a fad in which few cared to risk their necks, to the modern streamlined sport it is today, with scores of enthusiasts. Motorcycling has always had its thrills but the modern, high-powered machine goes further and combines all the speedy action of aquaplaning and flying, yet offers the pleasures and comforts of motoring. The city’s first motorcycle club in 1913 was a novel and, if it may be said, a noble experiment. It worked, and about a score of dashing young daredevils went in for motorbiking. Officers of that early club were George Bott, president; August Trutnau, vice president; Clarence H. Lauson, road lieutenant; E. J. Robb, activities chairman; 
       and Martin Curtis, racing chairman. With the horse and buggy era on the wane, young road demons, astraddle explosive two-wheeled gas burners, awed the town with feats of speed and daring. Motorcycling came into its own as one of the most popular sports of the day.Motorcycle racers thrilled thousands at the Midland Empire fair during the years from 1915 to 1920. In 1915 and 1916 races also were staged on a track at Joliet and hundreds of Billings fans traveled there regularly to watch those thrilling contests in which the more daring riders would sometimes hit a breakneck pace of “60 miles per hour.” State Racing Circuit In addition, there was a state motor-cycle racing circuit to coincide with fairs at Bozeman, Great Falls, Helena, Miles City, and Roundup. Several Billings riders competed in these early meets. They included Pat Curtis, Martin Curtis, 
       Bob Robb, George Tur-ner, Frank Boyd, Don Rieger, Fen Garvin, Johnny Thomas, Clar-ence Lauzon, Buck Engelhardt, Grant Lam-port and Fred Olsen. Favorite per-formers on the old Joliet racetrack were the Curtises, Turner, Robb, Nelson Wells and Frank Boyd. ""Those were the good old days,"" it was the motorcyclists who braved the stretches of open road on which no operator of a horseless carriage would dare to tread. They tackled bridges across streams, stretches of deep sand, oozy gumbo and miles of mud to go on where some of the difficulties surrounding even these early circuits sub-dued the timid. The city's first motorcycle club maintained active membership until 1917, when several of its members entered service for the World War. Between 1918 and 1921 there was a lull in activities. The Billings club was reorganized in 1921 and has been a functioning organization since. 
       In the years 1914 to 1917 Ira S. Dille, Harry Williams, Frank Boyd, E. J. Robb, Alec McLeod served as club presi-dents and Robert E. ""Bob"" Cooke was secretary-treasurer. When reorganized in 1921 C. M. Lauzon was elected presi-dent, A. Nicolas, vice president, and Frank Polesek, secretary-treasurer. New Popularity Peak Motorcycling today has hit a new peak in popularity and the Billings club has a large active membership. There are approximately 100 of the two-wheeled machines registered in Yellowstone County. The Billings Motorcycle Club promotes a full active program each summer, highlighted by such events as gypsy tours, reliability runs, and hill climbs. The club has been affiliated with the American Motorcycle Association since 1929. Endurance or reliability runs of the Billings club date back to 1916, when a 126-mile trip was made to Miles City and return. Dirt 
       roads, turned to mud by heavy rains, tortuous hills, and ruts made this endurance test live long in the memories of the riders who participated, including R. E. Cooke, Clarence Lauzon, Pat Curtis, Martin Curtis, E. J. Robb, Johnny Thomas, Frank Hayes, Carl Aurich, Don Rieger, and Fred Olsen. Other riders who took part in events of the early motorcycle club and who still reside in Billings were Dr. C. H. Nelson, C. G. Gans, Jimmie Noyes, Horace Noyes, Bob Freeman, Glenn Farrell, Gus Wanderling, Eddie Eichenhard, Dan Davies, Walter Fultz, Bob Mitchell, and Peter Yeegen Jr. The club today is headed by Charles Lasher, president; Herman Judd, vice president; Andrew Dukes, treasurer; and Fred Olsen, secretary.

        the first one of the sentence to be written out
        Then it passes to the next one and the next
        and so on, with more or less rapidity, a
        gentleman, who hat experimented with the
        thing, says: ""Sometime the table will cover
        two letters with Its feet and then yon hang
        on and ask that the foot be moved from the
        wrong letter, which will be done,""
        One man who tnougnt nit lamiiy was
        spending too much time over the talking ma
        chine burned it up. Then he left noma on a
        Journey. When the talking board could not
        be found some one made anotner, ana tne
        amusement went on. as before. To tho qu
        tion what had become of the other board the
        answer was given, ""Jack burned It up,
        which somewhat astonished Jack on his re
        turn.

        THE MORNING CALL, SAN FRANCISCO, TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 14, 18*3;'
        WEIRD WRITINGS.
        The Planchette Craze Has
        Broken Out Again.
        UNSEEN FORCES AT WORK.
        Some Uncanny Pranks of a Little
        Instrument That Once Held the
        Attention of the World.
        There Is a planchette fever in San Fran
        cisco.
        Clubs of patient sitters, anxious to hold
        communion with the dead and distant liv
        ing, have been formed here and in Oak
        land. Daily and nightly seances are being
        held.
        Plancbette is old, so old that it is almost
        new again. Early in the fifties the weird
        little contrivance was invented and ten
        years later nearly the whole civilized world
        was teaming with a recital of its wonders.
        The most uncanny tales were related of
        the marvelous doings of the instrument,
        and for a time the greatest scientific minds
        of the world were interested iv its queer
        pranks. Such men as Tyndall and Faraday
        were drawn Into controversies pro and con
        over the merits of this occult agency.
        Exhaustive essays were written and
        learned lectures delivered to prove that
        planchette was a fraud and to prove that
        planchette's powers were supernatural.
        But it all ended where it began. The
        deepest study and the most careful analy
        sis of the wiles and ways of planchette
        developed nothing of scientific value either
        to the student of the occult or the natural
        forces.
        And so the planchette fever died as
        quickly as it had grown. Men and women
        went back to their workaday world or con
        tinued their occult studies unuer different
        auspices. Planchette had it« little day nnd
        then died a natural death. Or, if it did not
        i die entirely, it lapsed into a slate of coma
        j from whicn it is only now being resur-
        I rected. To-day, in San Fraucisco aud in
        j Oakland, and perhaps In other parts of
        ihe world, great numbers of men and
        women are bent on solving the mysteries
        i that still cling to this little contrivance.
        And it is all because of that irrepressible
        j desire of man to penetrate the mysteries
        j of the future. f ,v
        What does to-morrow hold for me.
        That is the question nearest the heart of
        most men to-day. lt is a very part of the
        commercial spirit of the age. And as yet
        science has made no advances toward
        placing the means within reach of answer
        ing it. So planchette comes again to fill
        the gap between the known and the un
        known.
        What started the fever no one seems to
        i know. 'Hint it has been started and has
        already interested hundreds of intelligent
        men and women no one doubts, for the evi
        dence is clear.
        You know what planchette is, do you
        j not, and how it operates? Some have
        thought there was a hidden secret in its
        I construction, but this is wrong. Never
        was a wonderful device more simply con
        trived; There is first a heart-shaped cedar
        board. Pendant from the points of the
        angle are little legs with metal or wooden
        castors. At the end of the board is an
        aperture for the insertion of a lead pencil.
        Those who fit to planchette for communi
        cations from this world or the next place
        a baud each on the surface of the board,
        then wait till the ""spirit moves."" And
        the spirit has been moving pretty rapidly
        in these parts of the world for the last
        few nights. Dire things have been fore
        told and timely warnings given.
        Ordinarily planchette will write out
        what it has to say if time be given i\ but
        the quicker way is to write the alphabet
        and the simple negative and affirmative on
        a large sheet of white paper and let plan
        chette spell out its messages by pointing to
        tbe letters.
        It was this method pursued py a party
        of well-known clubmen who began as
        i skeptics Friday evening and went home at
        I daybreak firmly convinced that there were
        i at least many things that they had little
        j dreamed of In their phiiosophy. Only two
        members of the party placed tbeir hands
        on the instrument at one time. The others
        j looked on and scoffed.
        ""We were all unbelievers when we sat
        down to that table,"" said the member of
        the party who told the story to a Call
        man yesterday. ""For a while planchetie
        refused to move and we were almost on
        the point of giving it up for the night,
        when, without un Instant warning, the in
        strument gave a sudden jerk and almost
        flew from uuder the fingers of Jones and
        Smith.
        ""Roth the men turned pale at this and
        in order to rally themselves they accused
        each other of having moved the planchette.
        On their honor both men denied this, but
        since neither had believed his own accusa
        tion the denials were useless.
        ""I think it was a wife or a sister of
        Jones that came first. I bave forgotten
        the name of the spirit or influence, or
        whatever it was, that purported to move
        the instrument, but the information it im
        parted can be easily verified or disproved
        when the next news from Samoa arrives.
        ""It spelled out 'Apia' first, very clearly
        and unhesitatingly. Then it went on to
        say that a terrible hurricane would sweep
        over the Samoan Islands on the 10th of
        November and that two vessels would be
        lost In the storm. And touching this
        event it would say no more, though we
        plied it with queries for a long time.
        ""Another influence came. I remember
        tbe name, but shall not give it.
        'Dead or living?' asked Smith.
        'Living,' came the answer, but Smith
        knew this already, for the name it gave
        was the name of his sweetheart.
        'What have you to tell me?' queried
        Smith, and then he wished he had not,
        for the answer that came distressed bim
        sorely.
        ""Twill not marry you,' it spelled out
        with painful accuracy.
        'Why not?', was the natural question
        that followed when Smith had recovered
        his presence of mind and bad determined
        to face it out.
        'Because I like D— letter,' came the
        answer.
        ""Then two men glared at each other for
        a moment, for D— sat at the opposite end
        of the table waiting bis turn to try plan
        chette.^^StHß^^B^o96iQH''SK^
        ""Now, if It were not already notorious
        that D— hail been a little soft on Smith's
        sweetheart of late we would have passed
        over this little incident as one of the
        vagaries of plancbette. But Smith couldn't
        take it in this light. He was crushed, and
        Invited D— to take his place. 1 needn't
        tell you that D— declined the invitation,
        but I would stake a small sum that"" D—
        has his bands on a plancbette this moment.
        a,\*'l look Smith's place at the planchette
        and presently the' thing began ;to move
        again. This time it discarded the use of
        the alphabet and gave its message in writ
        ing.
        ""Now, I am not going to place any reli
        ance on this thing till I see how it turns
        out, but the message that came to me is
        Important if it is true.
        '""I am an enemy,' it wrote.
        '""Are you going to thrash him?' asked
        Jone?, who likes to be facetious when
        there is the least call for it.
        .""'No!' said planchette. Then after a
        pause it carefully wrote out, '1 am going
        to harm him. He is my enemy and I will
        be revenged.'
        ""Well, all this meant nothing without a
        name, and no name had been given yet.
        Again I asked for the name and ■it not
        only wrote oat the name of tbe man who
        happens to be smarting under a very just
        punishment that i Inflicted upon, him, but
        wrote it in bis own handwriting. a
        ''You should have seen some of the faces
        of the men who sal about that table when
        they recognized the handwriting. One of
        the men who bad laughed loudest and
        scoffed the most when we first sat down
        found it necessary to go outside for fresh
        air."" There was no more laughter tbat
        evening. i
        ""Then it came into my bead to ask plan
        chette something about itself, but before
        we put the questions both Jones and my
        self were blindfolded. This precaution is
        unnecessary, for it is simply impossible to
        move planchette as it does move without
        exerting a physical force that would be
        readily detected. However, we did this
        more to convince ourselves than others.
        "".'Are you inspired?' asked.
        ""'Yes,' came the answer.
        'By a good power?'
        ""The instrument fairly flew to the word
        'no.'
        'By the devil said Jones.
        'The devil,' it spelled out without the
        least hesitation. s:
        'Who are you?' I inquired.
        'An agent of the devil,' replied plan
        chetie, and this time in writing.
        ""And after that there was not a man in
        the room brave enough to put bis hand on
        that instrument.""
        The above questions and answers can
        be vouched for by -more than one man
        whose word in the commercial world is as
        good as his bond, and many similar dia
        logues might be cited to prove— prove
        well, to prove that plancbette has a strong
        hold on the people of this city once more.
        Whether the craze will die out before it
        reaches any great proportions again re
        mains to be seen.

        Tho oulja board Is coming back
        tnto favor and has been taken up
        I quit extensively by society women
        v In New York, Boston, Chicago, St.
        Louis and various parts of the coun
        try. Perhaps tho most remarkable le-
        Iccnt experiences with it arc those of
        Mrs, John Curran of St, Louis. Sho
        has been in communication, she says,
        with the spirit of Patience Worth, a
        woman beliovcd to have existed in
        lhe Colonial days and who not only
        has sent philosophical axioms that
        are characteristic of tho Puritans
        but even has gone to tho extent of
        sending outlines of plays and es
        says and has gone extensively Into
        the dictation of poetry. More than
        300,000 words havo been received
        from this supposed spirit in ihieo
        years.
        Patience Worth talks In a strange
        t English that is archaic and not
        J 1 found in the best authors and yet
        j may have at one time been the
        tongue of Inhabitants of this coun
        try. Long condemned by religious as
        the direct agency of satan and by
        i skeptics as the toy of the supcrsti-
        tlous, the ouija board is being ro
        f stored to its own former popularity
        I through the curiosity of society wo
        men. In many parts of the country oo
        clety women are devoting their timo
        to ""communicating"" with spirits in
        tho other world.
        Many sti'ango results of such com
        munications are reported and a ao
        t clety woman is unhappy indeed if

        B ways ready to send a message at her

        Ill Even in staid St. Louis where so-
        lit! cIety women arc supposed to bo
        1$ very conservative, tho ouija board
        il has been, restored to favor whilo
        HA
        in New York and In various
        cities of the east it is quite the
        ""rage.""
        In St Louis Mrs. John H. Curran
        has gotten into touch with one Pa
        tience Worth of Spiritland and has
        transcribed more than 300,000 words
        thiough the ouija board, all of which
        will be published at some future
        date.
        Patience Worth is believed from
        her peculiar choice of words and
        phraseology to be a Colonial dame,
        who has been wandering about In
        space for a long time, burning to
        send her messages back to the mun
        dane sphere yet finding no source of
        communication until Mrs. Curran
        bought a ouija board and com
        menced taking messages.
        THROUGH
        CURIOSITY.
        The board Avas purchased through
        curiosity. There is something fas
        cinating about the tales told of tho
        little board, whether they be- true
        or false. It is known that a num
        ber of people have asked the board
        to tell them in what land their dead
        iclativcs liugercd and were shocked
        considerable- when the naughty Utile
        hoard spelled out a word starling
        A ith an H and ending with an L.
        Many have thought that the words
        written bv the board were the result
        of the mental influences oC the per
        son opeiating it. while others have
        credited it with supernatural pow
        ers. In tho use of tho board at the Cur
        ran home, Mrs. Curran always is one
        of two whose ""hands are on the
        board. The latter is arranged on
        two wheels and has a pencil at the
        end. As the vibration of the fingers
        of tho holders develops the pencil
        moves over a sheet of paper and
        prints numerals o'r letters of the al
        phabet, While Mrs. Curran operates tho
        board her husband transcribes tho
        message as sho reads it to him.
        The ""Patience Worth"" matter be
        gan to be transcribed in June, 1913.
        Since that time Mrs. Curran has
        made public as the products of Pa
        tience Worth a six-act play entitled
        ""Red Wing."" a novel called ""Tclka""
        and numerous verses, essays and
        bits of philosiphy.
        The quaint language of these writ
        ings has probably attracted more at
        tention than their literary merit, tho
        latter being a matter of some dis
        cussion. They are in an antique
        language, not the English of Chau
        cer, Spenser or any other well-
        known classic English writer, but
        possibly more like the common
        speech of the English people of an
        early day.
        It is known to travelers that an
        antique, almost archaic, form of
        English still Is spoken in remote
        communities of England. Theie are
        districts of England whose inhabi
        tants have great difficulty in under
        standing or in making themselves
        understood by the coster-cockney
        class.
        Mrs. Curran, however, says sho
        has no personal acquaintance with
        such speech and that she has not
        gone farther in her study of classic
        English than other well read per
        sons. The language used' by Patience
        Worth, she explains, is as strange
        to her as It is to others.
        Mrs. Curran recently gave to the
        Fapyrus Club of St. Louis some of
        her messages from Patience Worth,
        one of them being a special messago
        that Patience had sent the club. It
        read:

        Mrs. Curran told her audience of
        her first experiences with tho ouija
        WW
        w
        board and of the puzzling messages
        received. Later sho used the'board
        together with Mrs Emily Grant
        Hutchings and began to receive
        sentences which foimcd maxims and
        philosophical paragrapbs. Then
        came the announcement:
        ""Many moons ago I lived. Patience
        Worth, my namo. If thou shalt live
        then so shall I. I make my bread by
        thy hearth""
        The word ""bread."" Mrs. Currau
        later learned, lefeired to the literary
        products embodied in the messages.
        Mrs. Curran said she would not at
        tempt to say whelhcr Patience
        Worth was a spirit, but spoko of ,ber
        as a beautiful personality, which had
        come to seem not a mystery but a
        fellowship.
        She said the messages came to her
        in daylight as well as at night and
        that there is no trance connected
        with them.
        ""The words come in sort o a
        rhythm,"" Mrs. Curran explained,
        ""and I record just what comes
        whether I understand it or not.""
        Pnticuce has been tested by rnoro
        than 200 persons and her messages
        have never varied. A professor from
        the University of Indiana visltod
        Mrs. Cunan to investigate her com
        munication with Patience Worth.
        William Marion' Reedy, editor of
        the Mirror, and Caspar Yost, editor
        of a SL Louis newspaper, became ac
        quainted with Patience Worth and
        both declaic her genuine. Yost has
        described her as a ""spinster of un
        certain age; a writer, but a poet by
        preference. White the average spirit
        stalks dismal and wailing lugubri
        ously through the flnito world, Pa
        tience comes with a laugh, Yost said.
        She remarks. ''I be no sorrj' singer,""
        and proves it by many witticisms.
        EDITOR
        DESCRIBES HER.
        Reedy calls Patience's doctrines
        Pantelstic.
        He describes her as follows: ""She
        fs a little woman, dressed In gtaj;
        with a little bonnet, ribbons coming
        down and tied under her chin. There
        are lines in her face, not the re
        written wrinkles of the smiles or
        her youth, but the results of ex
        perience Her eyes are biown liico
        autumn leaves after a rain. She Is
        -between 45 and 50 years old, spright
        ly, dainty, delicate.
        ""Sho has stood beside the stock
        ade helping a good man load a gun,
        while he defends the settlement
        against the savage horde of In
        dians."" Reedy said the theory was ad
        vanced that she was filled in an In
        dian massacre and this question was
        askcu of her. Sho intimated that
        something of this sort had happened
        to her and she was asked if she had
        not been taken captive oy the In
        dians. ""Nay, something worse,"" was her
        reply.
        '.'She speaks an English almost
        pure and undefiled,"" Reedy said of
        her ""There is an absence from it
        of all the derivatives of France and
        Rome, and sho rarely uses a word
        of more than two syllables. Her an
        swers are- diredt and almost invari
        ably in parables. She has respect
        for her interlocutor's intelligence.""
        Reedy said sho is not another
        Sappho, or George Elliott, or Mrs.
        Humphrey ward nor a Sara Teas
        dale,' but rather echoes of all of thct
        poets. He said theie runs a consist
        ent character through her works and
        in two years she has not gotten ""out
        of chaiactcr."" Sho never has used a
        modern word or expression and he
        illustrated the seeming significance
        of this by pointing out how difficult
        it would be for a man trained In
        Irish or negro dialect to make a 30
        minute talk without breaking out of
        the character.
        ""She has nothing lo tell, in my
        opinion, ""Reedy said, ""but she com
        mands my admiration and reverence.
        She tells nothing- that we have not
        heard from tho old masters and
        bards.""
        ""What of the divinity of Christ?""
        Kcody at one time asked her through
        the ouijd board. She answered, ""He
        bought thee of his loving.""
        ""What of love?"" he asked. ""Tho
        love there is but tho o'er drip of lovo
        here"" came the respou&c of tho
        board.
        ""Describe tho place where you
        are?"" sho was asked. ""Think you

        ""Put"" in Patience's vocabulary re
        sponds to the modern verb ""to do.""
        ""Patience may be a second person

        ""but she teaches a lovo that is
        greater than we can conceive and
        that death is the keeper of unknown

        LITTLE COLONIAL
        DAME.
        Mrs. Emily Hutchings, who -was
        one of the first to receive 'with Mrs.
        Curran the messages from Patlenco
        Worth, said the first glimmering or
        the quaint personality of the little
        Colonial dame came in the maxim:
        ""A busy saw gathereth no rust.""
        One of the sentiments expressed
        by Patience Worth is: ""A blighted
        bud may hold a sweeter message
        than the lovllest flower; for God
        hath kissed her wounded heart and
        left a promise there.""
        Of the seances, Mrs. Curran says:
        ""I sit with a friend, our hands up
        on the board, which I havo come to
        believe is nothing more than a con
        centrator. There is no trance. Ev
        erything is quiet with the exception
        of Patience Worth. The only
        definite part is that while I put my
        thoughts awhither, as Patience
        would Bay, and immediately the sto
        ries, poems, plays., parables, or
        whatever her work for the sitting IH
        may be, is shown to mo in tiny pic- JH
        lures, beautiful and distinct a3 IH
        though my eyes saw them.
        ""The characters move and speak H
        and my hands fly over the letters jH
        much too fast for me to anticipate- H
        even one word. J
        ""I cannot account for the langu- jH
        age. The words seem to be spoken ilH
        to me. though I cannot 'say 1 hear llH
        them In the sense that we hear tho iH
        voice that speaks aloud to us. The H
        words come m sort of a rhythm. I lH
        am not familiar with old Euglish jH
        and yet even the conversations -are H
        in this archaic tongue."" jH
        Psychologists recently havetakcn ,H
        up a"" study of Mrs. Curran and tho M
        Mvstcrlous Patience Worth. Some jM
        believe that Paticnco Worth is Mrs. jH
        Curran's sub-conscious self. Others jH
        have departed in doubt and without jH
        expressing an opinion. iH
        The ouija board has been con- JH
        demned by various religious bodies, iH
        but society is taking it up beside il
        these prohibitions. The Catholic tl
        church has condemned it as a super-
        stitlous practice. H
        Other religious bodies havo u- H
        clarcd that the devil is in hc boaid H
        and employs it to send his messages. H
        Whatever the truth may be, so-
        ciety has gone into the mystery of lH
        tho board, not so much with the ob- iH
        jeet of definitely deciding if it really jH
        is the medium of communication H
        with the other world but to,gratlfy H
        society's chief attribute Curiosity. H

        copyright name of the oracle 'and
        that later William Fuld started the

        William Fuld asserts that he and

        Is the original talking board, and

        SIX years ago Mrs. John H Curran, of St. Louis, a
        peculiarly healthy-minded, normal young woman,
        who is the wife of the former Immigration Commis
        sioner of Misitvouri, began for amusement to experiment
        with the ouija board. This peculiar instrument for receiv
        ing meaaages foom the beyond"" consists of a flat wooden
        board, about two feet long by one and a half wide, on
        which are th? letters of the alphabet, the numerala up to
        ten and the words ''Yea,"" ""Mo,"" ""Don't know"" and
        ""Good-by."" A little heart-shaped table on three legs is
        placed on top of the board. The sitters place the board
        upon their knees, the finger tips of both hands lightly upon
        the heart-shaped table. After a while an ""influence,""
        ""apirit"" or ""spook"" begins to move the heart-shaped
        board, whose narrow end then points to the letters, spell
        ing out the words of ?ta* message. A third person, an
        observer, acts as amenuensis, taking down the letters as
        the pointer indicates them.
        The ""mestages"" are accounted for by non-spiritualista
        as an expression of the sub-conscious self of one or both
        of the sitters; the mysterious movement of the table is
        supposed to be due to unconscious muscle rhythms of the
        hands of the sitters.
        Whatever the explanation, Mrs. Curran began to hear
        from someone who signed herself ""Patience Worth"" and
        who spelled out upon the board sentences in remarkable
        English?archaic, a forgotten dialect. This ghostly per
        sonage speedily developed into the strongest kind of a
        personality. She had been, she wrote, a maiden of Dor
        setshire. England, who lived about 1650. She was a
        weaver's daughter, an only child. She wrote that ""my
        thumb is thick from twisting flax"" and speaks of deliver
        ing fine linen to the ""castle folk."" Her father left to
        come to America, and after the death of her mother.
        Patience says she followed him to the new world. ?She
        was then thirty-five. Her new home was in the vicinity
        of Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket. Near there she
        tv a? buried, and now, she says, ""a tree grows out of my
        grave.""
        Soon she began to dictate stories and poems with ex
        traordinary rapidity and facility. The first book pub
        lished was ""Patience Worth."" The ""Sorry Tale,"" a
        story based on the episode of the impenitent thief on Ihe
        cross, came out in 1916 and ""Hope Trueblood."" the last
        book, was a story of old England.
        The remarkable literary excellence of these writings
        attracted widespread attention. Their dialect
        passed every teat of experts. It was proven that
        Mrs. Curran had no previous knowledge of them,
        nor had she the education displayed by the com
        munications. Dr. Martin F. Prince, the famous
        neurologist, diagnosed Patience ""asa sub-conscious
        personality of Mrs. Curran and offered to rid her of it
        by hypnotism. Mrs. Curran refused to have ""Patience""
        banished by this means or any other, and scoffs at the
        sub conscious theory. Other distinguished scientists
        studied her case, but with no better results.
        For three years the ""ghost"" of Patience Worth?or
        whatever it is that responda to that nam?2?had been dic
        tating to Mrs. Curran by means of the oirija board as a
        concentrator. One book had been printed, another waa
        on the way to the printer. The first book was already
        promising an excellent sale. Reviews had been flattering
        and the publie was becoming interested
        Then one evening, after the Currans had been' dis
        cussing this materialistically agreeable result of the.man
        ifestations, Patience Worth exploded a bombshell. In
        the quaint old English words which she uses she an
        nounced that inasmuch an there ""seemed to be some
        money in sight."" and since it did not belong to the Cur
        rans. ""but to God,"" that they should seek ""a wee babe
        that had nothing, nothing and take it and care for iti""
        This was. indeed, disconcerting. The Curran house
        was a well-filled one. There was a grandfather, a mother
        in-law, a stepdaughter and the husband and wife. Be
        sides, they had counted upon using the money for thorn
        selves.
        Patience, however, was determined and explicit. Sho
        caustically called attention to the fact that the emolu
        menta of her bock did not belong to those who simply
        took down her dictation, but that as the author and main
        spring of the volume the returns from it were hers to do
        with aa she Dleased.
        ""I am a weaver of cloth,"" said Patience on that night,
        in the curious imagery she loves to use, ""and this cloth
        weave is not for him who hath. Thou ehalt seek a wee
        one who hath naught, and thou shalt deliver the goods
        of me unto it? hands, and ye shalt speak ita name
        ?Patience Worth.""*
        This was an order, not a request 1 And to it when the
        first shock of surprise had worn off the Currans gladly
        bowed.
        ??L?ook ye.'' the '^heat** went on, ""this shall be one
        who is sorely in need, mind ye Ye ?hall whisper sweets
        unto it. even unto the wee ear that knoweth not thy
        words, and tell unto it of a fairy dame who shall minister
        unto it and of Him who sent her And she shell be the
        love of all who love me and shall smile sweeta unto
        them.*'
        ""But why a girl instead of a boyt"" the Currans aaked
        anxiously.
        ""Ye aee,'* answered Patience cryptically enough, ""a
        man laddie hath man'? cunning, but the wee dame??ah,
        I know I""
        The Curran? quite naturally asked about the parent
        age of the child, ita legitimacy and many other important
        things, not the least of which was a description of it so
        that they might know when they bad found tbe babe
        Patience had in mind
        She gave them certain directions???rather vague; told
        them ""not to mind earth's law but God's""?referring
        unquestionably to the matter of parentage and to watch
        close if there were any blood taints, but not to go back
        further than the grandparent?.. She wanted the child
        dressed simply, she concluded, and asked thai ""about its
        neck thou ?halt hang a sign of Him."" The Curran?, and
        rightly it, turned out later, construed this to mean
        cross.""
        ""Ye shall be upon tbe path! E'en now the wee one
        is waiting,"" she urged.
        So the hunt began for a child who wouid answer the
        description. The entire ""Patience Worth"" clan was sent
        out on the seareh. Two physicians were selected to ex
        amine it when found for blood taint! Much ground wa?
        covered in the next month. There were handicaps?an
        interesting one the refusal by a certain large St. Louis
        foundling institution to allow any baby to be taken from
        there because ""Mrs. Curran wrote on a ouija board.""
        During this search ""Patience,"" who seems to have a
        strange sense of humor at times, remained silent. Then
        one night, according to Mrs. Curran, she directed them
        to cease, telling them there was no use in looking for
        ""one that was not whole,"" and that in due time certain
        signs would be given them whereby they would know
        what to do adding that if they did continue it would be
        ""like a wolf seeking for a fat fowl to feed well upon
        when the bird was still in the egg."" After this, other
        weeks passed by without any reference being made by
        ""Patience Worth"" to the matter.
        Then one morning Mrs. Curran met an old friend
        whom she had not seen for years, and in the course of a
        ride together told some of the details of the quest for the
        baby. The friend, in return, told of a young wife who
        was about to become a mother, who was practically home
        less and friendless, and whose husband had been killed
        some time before in a mill accident. That night g mes
        sage from ""Patience Worth"" indicated that at last the
        Curraros were on the right track and that which she had
        prophesied M'as about to occur.
        The next day Mrs. Curran went to see this woman,
        who was very ill. A fever of preparation began imme
        diately. Layette cradle, perambulator, lawyers, adoption
        papers?everything was made ready just as though the
        thing were already settled. Seemingly the possibility
        that the expected child might be a boy was never for a
        moment considered.
        The mother-to-be signed the adoption papers, but held
        them under the agreement that if she lived she was to
        keep the expected child, but that if she died, then the
        Currans were to have the baby.
        Six weeks later, as Mrs Curran was writing with
        ""Patience"" upon the now well-known ""Sorry Tale,"" the
        ""ghost"" stopped the dictation at exactly nine o'clock.
        ""This be enough,"" she wrote, and the board became
        quiet.

        REVELATION OF OUIJA
        FORMS BASIS OF LAW SUIT
        Lockport, 111., Feb. 24.An Ouija
        board and its uncanny revelations
        form the basis of a $10,000 suit here
        against Albert Yost. Recently Yost's
        home was burglarized. An Ouija
        board was consulted to solve the mys
        tery surrounding the robbery. Answ
        ering the question ""Who robbed my
        house?"" the board is said to have
        replied ""Frank Walter."" Walter is
        Yost's neighbor. They have been
        lifelong friends. The board is also
        said to have implicated Mrs. Walter.
        The board's accusations became
        known to Mrs. Walter, who called at
        the Yost home. She was told the
        Yosts had nothing to retract and
        forthwith filed suit for $10,000
        against Yosts, alleged slander. The
        Yosts deny the charge and insist they
        have uttered no word which might be
        interpreted as defaming the charac
        ter of the Walters.

        Ouija Board Invades Britain
        LONDON, Nov. 10.
        THE ouija board has invaded
        Britain! It masquerades un?
        der the pseudonym of ""plan?
        chette,"" but it is the familiar
        alphabet and flatiron device that has
        helped to while away the tedium of
        prohibition in the United States.
        And apparently it has landed in
        force, because even now officials of
        women's clubs are debating as to
        whether the planchette is a game,
        or, if it isn't, what it is.
        ""If it is a game."" argued one club
        secretary, ""it should be played as a
        game In the cardroom and during
        the regulation card hours. As it is,
        the planchette enthusiasts are busily
        occupied with their favorite pastime
        from early morn to dewy eve.""
        Although she waxed poetic at the
        end, it was evident that the official
        was really disturbed about the exact
        status of the planchette. F->r it is
        said that the fascinating business of

        Whether there is truth in a statmmnt that the ouija
        board is adding patients to Wasinta asums
        through disturbing infinenoes augon District mentalitin,
        students of mental phenomena will be inteAsted in the
        fact that the board takes its name from the French
        word oui (yes) and the German word ja (yes). Its
        origin is somewhat obscure. Both the planohette and
        ouija, somewhat simila in appearanes, date back to
        about 1855, and for a while were objects of consider
        able superstition. The planchette is a small board
        fitted with a pencil and two casters, made to move
        easily over a sheet of paper when the hands rest lightly
        on it. The dictionary says the ouija ""is a form of
        planchatte used in spiritualistic seaness or the like.
        It consists of two parts, a board containing the al
        phabet and other characters, and a planehette, with
        a pointer substituted for the pencil.""
        Investigation of automatic writings fail to find that
        the two boards have any origin in the mysticisms of
        Egypt. One writer is of the opinion that the iret at
        tempt in ouijaing was made by a man on his wife's
        breadboard. The skeptical refer to the board as
        wholly a modem trick afair which has no connection
        with Eastern or other metaphysics.
        Some of the noted spiritualists of the world make use
        of the ouija or planchette and carefully study the
        results. An able group of psychologists regard the
        ouija as a dangerous deception. Their theory is that
        the subconscious mind of the operator directs the
        fingers in such a way as to convey the information
        hoped for. The operator, they hold, is as innocent of
        this subconscious process as a sleep-walker is of what,
        he is doing, and naturally puts a supernatural con
        struction on the outcome.
        Leading spiritualists and other believers in higher
        agencies than natural ones, confident that communica
        tion with the other world is not only established but
        is developing into an understanding that will glorify
        humanity, are willing to accept the ouija board or any
        other method of transmission that will add ti the in
        formation they feel they now possess. Those of ma
        terial minds, who deride all supernatural beliefs and
        theories, hold to the opinion that after every great
        war there is a wave of the occult in some form, and
        say that right now the ouija board happens to be the g
        most popular man-made medium of bringing together
        terrestrial pinds and celestial beings and thoughts.

        Ouija-Board Silliness
        It has been said that the average newspaper reporter is
        just as honest and reliable as the average person that he inter
        views. We accept this as true so long as the person inter
        viewed is present in the flesh, but when it comes to the honesty
        and reliability of those persons who communicate with the de
        parted spirits, we draw the line. There we halt. An inter
        view with a pencil and pad as the mediums is something reason
        able, but when the pencil and pad are thrown away, and a
        table or ouija board duplicated, then the thing begins to look
        spooky. And—just think—you could quote the poor spirit
        anyway you wanted to, and yet he, it, or she, would have no
        recourse, except possibly by haunting you. And anyone hav
        ing the nerve to hold a telepathic conflab with a spirit would be
        above fearing a ghost. Senator Sorghum in the flesh could
        scare the editor into making a correction, or a retraction, but
        how could a spirit institute libel proceedings against anyone?
        There is some credulity behind even the most serious scien
        tific facts, especially in the earlier stages of their development.
        But there is considerable difference between a speck of credul
        ity and a great expanse of human gullibility. Any violent dis
        turbance, like the great war, tends to distort people’s emotions
        and reason, even more than it does their action and will. This
        must be the explanation of the tidal wave oi spiritualism that
        is now sweeping this country. The revers >n to the belief in
        the existence of ghosts is simply the bringing into pronounced
        relief of the state of mind that our ancestors exhibited. The
        burning of witches at Salem was of its fruitage. Spiritualism
        is superstition curtailed by law. As its disciples no longer
        have access to the stake and the guillotine, they must amuse
        themselves as best they can with table-rappings, ouija boards,
        and other such paraphernalia.
        The fact that such men a3 Sir Richard Crookes and Sir
        Oliver Lodge are converts to spiritualism gives little support to
        the hoax, for even a layman can find serious flaws in their evi
        dence, and such men as Joseph Jastrow and Sir Edward Clodd
        can veritably tear their tenets to shreds. From its inception,
        spiritualism has been founded on trickery and frauds, and no
        proof has yet been brought forward showing that the present
        revival is not concocted of the same ingredients. Even if such
        were not the case, we have our hands full of problems as it is,
        without giving heed to the imaginary gibbering of disembodied
        ghosts.

        Ghost of Highworth Rd.
        Returns After Exorcism
        BRISTOL. ENGLAND. ""Mrs.
        It,"" the ghost of 13 Highworth rd.,
        is back again—with a playmate.
        Only recently the haunt was ex
        orcized by a Church of England
        vicar in a religious rite to drive
        away spirits taken from early
        Cristian records.
        The peace of No. 13 was short
        lived. Mr. and Mrs. William Ba
        ber, who live in the house, say the
        ghost now does a nightly routine
        up and down the stairs with an
        unidentified partner. Sometimes
        it sounds like they're dancing,
        sometimes like wrestling.
        The Baber theory is that the
        original ghost—which they named
        ""Mrs. It""—is that of a woman who
        died in the house 18 years ago.
        ""Mrs. It"" first began prowling
        around the place in December.
        The vicar, the Rev. Francis
        Maddock, went through a rite of
        exorcism after a month of nightly
        uproar at No. 13.
        One night the Babers called in a
        spiritualist. All they found out is
        that ""Mrs. It"" (1) speaks a foreign
        language—possibly Russian and
        (2) is an atrocious speller.
        A ouija board was used to see
        if she had any message. What
        came out was ""EEHFHMEV.""

            Table tennis is the name of a new game which
            was introduced in England a short time ago.
            and has already become one of the most popu
            lar of indoor amusements. It is the came
            of lawn tennis in miniature, played on an or
            dinary dining table. The net is a tiny one, made
            of gauxe stretched between two uprights, which
            rest on a bar laid across the table. The balls
            are made of the thinnest kind of pyroxyline ma
            terial, and are consequently very light. The
            racquet has a slender handle and a blade with
            a frame about one-half inch thick, which Is cov
            ered on both sides with thin drumhead Material.
            The play and counting are practically the satnas in lawn tennis, but, according to the rules,
            '•the player serving must not put his racquet
            over the table nor have it above his wrist."" That
            is, he must serve underhand and never over
            hand, but after service he may hit the ball as he
            likes, but he most not volley.
            The contact of the light ball with the drum
            head racquet produces a pleasant sound, and
            because of this sound th(» game received the
            name ""pompom.""
            Among the rules for playing the game are the
            following:
            No faults are allowed: if a fault is served.
            that is, the ball does not go over the net or goes
            off the table without touching the opposite side
            to the server, a |M>int is counted to the non
            server.
            If the net is touched by the l»all. and the ball
            goes over, and otherwise the service is correct,
            it is a let. and counU nothing to either side.
            If a volley is taken a point is counted against

            WHICH HAS ATTAINED GREAT
            POPULARITY IN LONDON;
            The three men who occupied the studio flat
            were having their quiet end-afternoon srnoks
            together. There was the artist, w hose hair haj
            turned gray after long years of painting an*
            black and white doings; the youth who, fcesi
            from art school, was just making a start, and
            the man of business, who was the saving clause
            of the combination. He put up the money wh»3
            black and whites would not sell and the youths
            checks from home were delayed In the mails.
            ""I wish people would find something new wia
            which to entertain us, said the man of buij.
            ness, in a bored tone.
            ""New Year is coming,"" chirped the youth, aa
            obvious statement, setir.g that Christmas «xj
            just one day past. ""Perhaps Santa Claus tLpgti
            off' the dear girls to a new game.""
            There*! nothing new under the sun. Billy*
            said the •Id artist. ""If taert was I'd draw it jj
            hurry.""
            Then there came a knock on the door, and a
            messenger appeared with a dainty note. Billy
            grasped it hastily. Billy was in love.
            ""It's addressed to all of us,"" he said, with di*.
            appointment.
            ""All the more reason you should hurry up aaj
            lead it,""' commanded the man of business.
            ""It's from Harriet,"" he murmured, as he read
            it to himself.
            ""Head out loud, uli>.t"""" commanded one of the
            older men.
            ""Won't you ccme up to-morrow night and
            play ping-pong."" read Billy. ""Now, what is
            ping-pong?""
            ""Search me?"" remarked the one who was nut
            artistic, except when it came to making money.
            ""Sounds Chinese,"" said the artist.
            ""I've heard of 'pom-pom,' remarked BiUy.
            ""That's a sort of big gun which makes a funny
            noise."" Billy had ence had the idea of beeoininj
            a military man. ""But ping-pon^r— that's a new
            one on me.""
            ""Some new style of bridge. I suppose."" mut
            tered the artist. ""It's not for me. I've sacri
            ficed enough on that altar.""
            ""Well. I'm going up to play ping-pong,"" an
            nounced the youth. ""I don't care what it is, tit
            name's new. Better come along. Jack. You
            were growling a minute ago about there being
            nothing new, and here you are.""
            Dilly went to Harriet's and played ping-pong,
            and when he had not retumeO by midnight th«
            other fellows knew that he was enjoying it. H«
            would not tell them what the new game was
            when he finally put in an appearance, but ad
            vised them to find out for themselves.
            An indoor edition of tennis is ping-pong, til*
            name coming from the curious sound which tie
            parchment rackets give forth when they striis
            the little balls. It is played on the dining room
            taMe, across the centre of which a low net is
            stretched. Th> rules are almost the same as
            in tennis, and the points are counted tennis
            fashion. There is even mure chance for skilful
            handling of the ball than In outduor game*
            and there are tricks innumerable which add
            interest and variety. Skilful players can ii??
            up the volleying process until interest reaches
            fever pitch. It is almost as exciting for tie
            spectators as for the players, which U core
            than can be said of tennis.
            It is an absorbing game, as the EngHsh S«l
            tell you. It his been played i:i London ilisisj
            romis for the last two or three years; but ha
            never been strictly in vogue until this winter
            The ollieers of the British army carried pir.g
            peng sets to South Africa with t'.u-m. and have
            set up their tab) on tho wldt when the Ecea
            let them remain Ln camp long enough.
            Why the game has not taken hold in tiia
            country is something which Americans who live
            In London cannot understand. They have writ
            ten home about the beauties and delisht3 o! v
            ping-pong. They laud it to the skies for tie
            exercise it affords to busy c.tn who have o
            work in offices all day. and to women who
            occupied with a round of teas a^d recepucsi

              Wher
              ever there is room for a dining table therfj
              is room for ping-pong, and tho fascination
              that the gamo nor. holds, especially amon
              tho smart set. cannot bo downed by warn;
              m cather.

              ning ping-pong holda sway. It is proper
              nowadays for young ladies to take soma
              form of physical exercise, and ping-ponB
              combines all the pleasure that they- may
              find in any exercise and affords all tha
              sport of play. j
              Ralph and Walter McKittrlck, Arthua
              Shepley and Dan KIrby- are among the best
              and most enthusiastic players In the city.
              The Country Club and tho Florissant Club
              are utterly crazed over tho game. At pres
              ent It holds the trumps over all other
              games, and from Indications it will be tha
              popular game of the summer at both clubs.
              Of course, this does not mean that tenn!
              and golf and polo will not havo their de
              votees, but ping-pong will bo tho most frequently-
              played gamo of tho season.
              The women of the city are us enthusias
              tic .as the men-possibly more so. and they
              havo their claims upon the attention of tho
              men and their sports. Ping-pong looks and
              sounds llko a game that does not requira
              as much cndtiranco and strength as other11
              spons anu tint is sid to bo tho reuson
              that the women have taken It up. As t,
              matter ot fact. It is as violent as nlmnst
              any gamo th it Is popular with many peo
              ple, but It seems so playful that tho weaker
              be. have seized upon It.
              It is a fact that one business man of this
              c ty a man or more than usual corpulence-
              has reduced his weight by forty pounds
              playing ping-pong. And If the truth mi.ro
              known, it is probably true tint several
              women have been enabled to become mora
              sylph-like through the medium of the game.
              But that Is .v matter concerning which
              women will not talk.
              Women who are onenlv .anient nl.-ners
              of
              ny
              ping-pong are rot the ones of whom any
              one can say they play to reduce thel
              weight. They- are modern women In every
              may, and have taken up tho game not only
              because it Is tho fad, but also because it
              Is a g ime that enables them to keep In
              good physical condition It is proper no
              longer for momtn to be weak and requiring
              the attention of maids and menr but they
              mut be able to cope with the strongest.
              Accordingly, they tako as much exercise,
              comparatively, as men And ping-pong of
              fers them something in the way of a gam
              that has not been offered by any thins
              else.
              Among the more prominent women play
              ers of ping-pong are Mrs. James Drurr
              mond, Mrs. William' Gregg, Mri. Laurence
              J. Mornn MIs ickham. Mis Mitchell.
              Mrs. E O. Stanard, Mrs. W. II. Walker
              and Mrs. Goodman King. Each of theso
              has an elaborate ping-pong room fitted up
              nt her house, and parties are frequent. It
              is not at nit unusual for them to meet in
              the morning and play arduously befora
              luncheon. It serves as an excellent appe
              tizer. The game was hroiight 'to St. Louis by
              two people at about the same time. Mrs.
              E. H. Semple ot Westminster place be
              came enamored of the game while abroad
              last summer, and when she returned she
              set up a table at once. Sirs. Sidney Walker
              appeared on the scene at about the sama
              time, an enthusiastic player of the game.
              That mas its start In thi3 city. It did not
              take long to bring the sport to its present
              position, but these two St. Louisans havo
              been instrumental In making it a fad.
              One of the best players among the women
              is Mrs. Lewis Haywood She has for sev
              eral months been a devotee, and lias ac
              quired remarkable 'kill in handling tho
              racquet. Mrs. John Fowler Is another ex
              cellent player, and Mrc Dan Taylor, Mrs,
              Campbell Smith and Mrs. Frank HammeS
              are also in the first class.

              WASHINGTON, D. C. May 21.—Mover
              j lias the national capital been so com-
              T-letely enslaved by the fascinations of a
              game, indoor or outdoor, as it has fallen
              (under the seductive influence of the won
              jdc-rful new game, which, having set all
              J l^ngland crazy, has come with- a power
              to] stride across the Atlantic to exercise
              its potent influence upon our social life.
              i As a prominent leader of Washington
              I society remarked the other day, ""Wash
              ington has fairly gone ping-pong mad.""
              Conversation in capital society has now
              i foe-come impregnated with the peculiar
              I terms of the new pastime. Where for
              merly one would hear ""social precedence""
              and ""rising man,"" one now hears ""clever
              i (half volleyer"" and ""invincible striker
              I out.""
              ""Love"" and ""advantage"" as topics of
              social conversation have now a ping-pong
              significance entirely foreign to their for
              xtx-r meaning among the capital gossips.

              The peculiar ping-pong of the celluloid
              balls as they are beaten to and fro (from
              ■which the game derives its name) is now
              to be heard j in every Washington home
              from the palatial mansion of the fam

              ping p has attained a surprising vogue
              ■among Washington's public men.
              All the leading hotels and cafes are
              hastening to open up ping-pong parlors
              on their premises, so that their distin

              tor a few minutes' serious consideration
              before discussing the idea with a smile.

              has taken upon members of the-house,

              As may be supposed, the stores have
              not been slow to take advantage of the
              commercial possibilities of the craze. In

              Ping-pong may abolish the tight laced
              ■corset.
              Ping-pong is essentially an informal
              game to be played at the spur of the
              moment, as the whim seizes. It is a

              fully swing forms, keep the merry cellu
              loid ball ping-ponging across the table

              This good may ping-pong do; bu other
              wise what peculiar qualities has the same
              to '-rive it phenomenal popularity? Strict
              ly speaking it is nothing more or less
              then a table adaptation of lawn tennis
              and tennis, while possessing to an equal

              Played on Dining Table.
              Ping-pong is played on an ordinary din-
              Ing table and its only accessories are
              posts tp hold the net, the net itself
              vellum string or wood-racquets and cellu-
              loid balls: The game is for two people
              one standing on one end of the table,
              the other opposite. The player who first
              delivers the ball is called the server The
              Other the striker out. i The service is
              strictly underhand and is delivered from
              beyond the end of the table.
              The: ball served must drop on the table
              beyond the net and is then in piav. if
              it dops into the net or off the table it
              counts to the striker out
              The server wins a stroke if the striker
              out fails to return the service or ball in
              play of the table.
              The striker out wins a stroke If the
              server fails to return the ball in play or
              makes a foul in service.
              On either player winning his first stroke
              the score la 15. The second stroke brings
              the score to 30; the third stroke is called
              •40 and the fourth stroke wins a game
              The player who wins the first six games
              -wins a set.-
              This is all there really is to the game
              of ping-pong. Certainly it Is a skill de
              manding and skill acquiring game. It
              lias simplicity and cheapness to recom
              mend it. It is far better from a hygenie
              standpoint than a majority of parlor
              prames and is an extremely socialble and
              interesting pastime. It is. for these rea
              sons and its similarity to tennis, a game
              calculated to prove attractive to the""
              younger members of both sexes.

              countries almost crazy: why old as well

              players suffer from an inflammation of
              the eye. and champion players add their
              Testimony. The constant watching of the

Americans now understand that those among them who subscribe to the completion of this grand work, will perform an act of patriotism, and at the same time one of International comity worthy of the enlightened ideas permesting this nineteenth century. Some idea of the extent of the pub-lic sentiment is shown by the fact tbat the New York World has been able to report subscriptions of over $30,000 in a month's time, in sums averaging less than $1"" each, the great bulk of these contributions being in dimes and quarters.
            What a aiagniflcent object it will be, towering almost into the clouds from New York's beautiful harbor! It will stand as a grand symbol of liberty be-fore the eyes of every one coiaiug frol l the oppressed countries beyond the ocean. At the gateway of no other nation oould it stand with such ap-propriateness. Here it symbolizes the fullest achievement of human freedom and will forever stand to tell that story.

            Liberty Enlightening the World.
            This now Wonder of the World, which is
            now being loaded on the French transport lsere
            for shipment to this country, is tho largest
            statue in tho world. Somo idea of its magni
            tude may bo obtained from tho fact that 40
            persons found standing room within the head.
            A six-foot man standing on tho level of tho
            lip3 only just reached the eyebrow. Whilo
            workmen wero employed on the crown of her
            head they seemed to bo making a huge sugar
            caldron, and they jumped with caso in and out
            tho tip of tho nose. Fifteen pcoplo might sit
            round tho flame of tho torch, which elevation
            can bo reached by a spiral staircase within tho
            outstretched arm.
            Tho London Daily Ncics, in speaking of it,
            says It is out aud away the largest statue of
            modern times. Tho Colossus of Rhodes was
            nothing to it. It could carry tho 'Bavaria' or
            tho 'Hermann' in its arms. It towers to tho
            skies from tho yard of the Ruo do Chazelles,
            whoro it has been eight years in construction,
            and tho view from its coronet sweeps clear of
            the six-story hbuses and beyond tho walls of
            Paris.""
            Tho weight of this stupendous statuo is 440,
            000 pounds, of which 170,000 pounds are cop
            per and tho remainder wrought-iron. It is
            expected to arrivo in New York about the 25th
            of May, whero it will bo erected ou Bedloe's
            Island, this being the location selected for it by
            Gen. W. T. Sherman, who was appointed by tho
            President to mako the selection. When placed
            in position it will loom up 305 feot above tide
            water, tho hight of tho statuo being 151.2 feet,
            that of tho pedestal 91 feet, aud foundation
            52.10 feet.

            the steeple of Trinity Church, which is tho
            loftiest in tho city of New York, higher, in
            fact, than any of tho colossal statues of anti
            quity by its rare artistic proportions, as well
            as by its stupendous dimensions, will add an
            other to tho Wonders of the World. A word
            should bo said of its artistic ""merit. The pose,
            stride, and gesture, with its classic face, aro
            pronounced perfect; the drapory is both mass
            ive and fine, and in some parts is as dclicato
            and silky in effect asif wrought with a fino
            chisel on tho smallest scale.
            The committco in charge of the construction
            of the baso and pedestal for tho reception of
            this great work aro in want of funds for its

            The canvas mask that has hidden the face of the Goddess of Liberty since last Wednesday was taken off for an hour or two yesterday afternoon, as if in compliment to the immense crowd of visitors to Bedloe's Island. The steamer John Field, instead of reappearing as promised, was put through another course of repairs, and the little steamer Water Lily took its place, to the great delight of all who have to travel often to the statue's out-of-the-way site. The island itself looks fresher and cleaner than it has in weeks. The grandstand and the speaker platform are built along the parapets and are all set up. The barren parts of the grounds have been cleared and leveled on the top and sides. Grass seed has been sown all over, and it is beginning to sprout here and there. The unsightly old boards have been burned, and the loose stones and rubbish from the work have all been carted back to the gullies at the island's western end. The hammering still continues on the right arm and shoulder blade of the Goddess, but practically, the great figure is ready for unveiling at any time."

The New York Tribune thus recounts the history of the great work of M. Bartholdi, which was unveiled on Thursday of last week in the New York harbor. The history of the Bartholdi statue from its inception to its unveiling is a checkered one and goes back through all sorts of delays and difficulties for almost twenty years.It was, strangely enough, just at the close of the disastrous war with Germany and while the horrors of the Commune were still raging in Paris that M. Laboulaye, the founder of the French-American Union, first definitively broached his patriotic project of building in this country a joint memorial of the struggles of the French and Americans in the Revolution, and sent the young sculptor Bartholdi to the United States to find, if possible, some suitable and happy idea.The first suggestion of the statue, perhaps, dates still further back to a dinner given under the Empire by M. Laboulaye at his country house, ""Glavigny,"" near Versailles.  "

            How to Practice Yoga Bright sunshine pours into the room in which Mr. Dulin practices yoga himself. Windows on three sides and a skylight help to make the room cheerful, which he says adds greatly to the effect. In one corner is a small skeleton chair which he calls his yoga chair. It is straight-backed and would prove anything but comfortable for library use, but there is little chance of anyone letting his attention wander so far afield while sitting in it that he would fall asleep, in any sense of the term. For this reason, the chair is all the more valuable for the practice of yoga. Seated on this chair or standing, the practitioner goes through thirty minutes of concentrated mental and muscular exercises every morning and afternoon. These exercises consist largely of assuming more or less strained postures and in regulating the breath. Standing straight as a soldier on parade, Mr. Dulin illustrated the exercises. 
            Placing one hand over his right nostril, he drew in slowly a deep breath through his left nostril, rising on his toes as he did so. When he had filled his whole lungs, he closed the left nostril too and still on tiptoe held his breath for about thirty seconds. Then, opening his right nostril, he exhaled slowly. This exercise is repeated seven times, and then the breath is drawn in through the right nostril and exhaled through the left. Another exercise consists of rising on the toes and at the same time placing the outstretched arms above the head with hands clasped and also drawing a deep breath, which is held for a number of seconds. Still other breathing exercises are taken while sitting on the yoga chair. Breathing Affects Mental Activity.""I drive each breath into every part of my body or into such part as my will designates,"" said Mr. Dulin. ""My attention is concentrated directly upon what I am doing. The motion 
            of the lungs has a very intimate relation to the activity of the mind. If we control the motion of the lungs, the activity of the mind comes more easily under control. Conversely, if we control the activity of the mind, we can also control the motion of the lungs. When the motion of the lungs is brought under perfect control, every organ of the body is brought under the control of the spirit. Have you ever noticed that at the time of perfect concentration of mind the rhythm of respiration changes and gradually becomes slower and slower; perhaps it will almost cease for the time being. It has been said by a clever and experienced thinker, Dr. Lewes, that to acquire the power of attention is to learn to make our mental adjustments alternate with the rhythmic movements of respiration. How intimately breathing is connected with life is apparent to anyone who stops to think of the so-called phenomena of living. As soon as 
            breath ceases, the very body itself disintegrates. When supreme control over attention is acquired by voluntary effort, it is possible to fix one's attention on any part of the body and experience strange sensations and wonderful phenomena. It is a well-known fact that one can easily experience pain in any part of the body by merely fixing the attention upon that part. By an analogous process, one can get rid of pain in the body. Mental healers, many of whom surround their practices with all manner of mysticism, are familiar with such phenomena, although they fail to understand the true inwardness of their cures. One can cure disease by fixing attention on the diseased part and sending an opposite current of thought. This method has become a common practice with Christian Science healers, and other mental healers under a variety of names. But one thing should be remembered in this connection. It is that each individual
            is born with this kind of healing power himself or herself. No one can give you that power. It is one of the natural powers of the human mind. It is far better to heal yourself than to go to some other person for a cure, which, at best, is only temporary. Do not let your mind be controlled by any other mind. Men and women who go to mental healers or Christian Scientists for help and who allow themselves to be influenced by the minds of others, do not realize that, by allowing themselves to fall under the hypnotic power of stronger minds, they are walking in a path which leads to mental degeneration. Many cases have been known where minds have degenerated into the slaves of other minds, losing all power of self-control. How pitiable is the mental condition of these self-deluded ones. ""Because a yogi comprehends this danger he never allows himself to be influenced by the minds of others. And for the same reason he is careful 
            about attempting a cure of his fellow-beings. While through perfect concentration it is possible to cure an ill person other than himself the yogi rarely attempts this, knowing the danger to which he is submitting his patient. Vedanta teaches the power which is latent in every human being for self-cure. We do, however, at times, and have done so in extreme cases such as fever. I could reduce a high fever by means of the power of concentration.""But if yoga is rightly practiced it should prove a preventive rather than a cure for disease. Anyone who is practicing yoga daily should be in perfect health. It gives immunity from disease. Since I have practiced yoga I have never been ill for a moment. It hardens the physical body to such an extent that it can combat with ease the so-called germs of disease. What are germs? Anyway but the creation of the human mind? The invention of a human mind would be willing to eat all the 
            bacteria you bring me and feel no evil effect.""""If that is the case and the whole human race should take up the practice of yoga the average age of man would be greatly advanced, would it not?"" Mr. Dulin was asked.""Undoubtedly,"" replied he. ""The effect of yoga upon longevity is marked. Man should live to be 125 years old."" Mr. Dulin has picked the age which the Russian scientist, Metchnikoff, selected for the average length of life of man. According to the Russian, however, man can attain this great age by living largely on buttermilk and a wonderful bacillus discovered by himself. Four Divisions of Yoga. There are four grand divisions of yoga, and each division is suited to a different tendency of mind. The first division of yoga is called Karma Yoga. It is for the active man, for those who like to work, the busy everyday workers in mankind. It is largely the science of physical culture. By this means the true science 
            of physical culture is reached. depends upon the concentration of the mind upon work in hand as well as the mere going through with certain exercises. Karma Yoga teaches the secret of work, and shows how to turn the daily tasks into acts of worship. Thus man may reach perfection of life through work and work alone. Bhakti Yoga is the name given to the second division. It is for such as are of an emotional nature. It teaches how ordinary emotions may bring forth a spiritual unfoldment of the highest kind and lead to the ultimate ideal of all religions. It explains the nature of divine love. The third division is Raja Yoga, which has to do with the whole realm of psychic phenomena. By its psychic powers are developed such as have astonished the world since the beginning of history, and which have been termed miracles by the uninitiated. This division includes the evolving of the fine perceptions, the projection out of the 
            body of the power of life, the curing of disease, and all the physical powers displayed by Jesus, and are in use by the Christian Scientists today. These phenomena have been known and understood by the yogis of India since ancient times. While Raja Yoga teaches all these psychic powers, it does not fail to warn its students that they are not the end of wisdom nor a sign of spirituality. ""Little brains and weak intellects easily turn away from the path of spiritual truth when some psychic power begins to manifest itself,"" said Mr. Dulin. ""They think they have reached the highest state of spirituality because they have the power of curing a headache."" Jnana Yoga is the fourth division or method. It is for the intellectual discriminative and philosophical man. Value of Yoga in Business. ""Of what tremendous value Yoga proves to business men can readily be understood aside from its spiritual value,"" continued Mr. Dulin. 
            ""In these days of competition it is the man who can concentrate upon his work and perform it, shutting out all other interests, who goes to the front most rapidly. The practice of Yoga demands concentration and Concentration before everything. The habit of concentration grows greater as the practice of yoga continues. For example, I can today accomplish in a few hours what would have a few years ago required several days of hard work. Vedanta explains the true basis of ethics. Why should we be moral? Not because it is written in a certain chapter of a certain Scripture, but because of the spiritual oneness of the universe. When you realize that you are part and parcel of the whole creation, you know that if you injure others, you injure yourself, and no one gains anything to himself under such a belief. Vedanta believes that for the time being, at least, this is for his good. No criminal commits a crime without thinking 
            that he is to benefit thereby. Vedanta shows that because of this same spiritual oneness, we should love our neighbors as ourselves since in spirit we are already one. ""Thirst for enjoyment is the real disease in us. Its various symptoms are passions, ambition, pride, jealousy, hatred, anger, and all the rest. Tremendous mental exertion of will power is often necessary to control the restless mind from taking the forms of waves of passion and anger. Perfect self-control of a yogi is that state of mind in which no desires or passions of any kind disturb the peace and tranquility of his soul. Such a state of mind can be acquired more easily by removing the bubbles of desires before they take the form of passion; that is, by attacking them while they are in their incipiency. By concentration and meditation upon the supreme truths, the desires may be brought under complete control.""
            Vedanta teaches that the soul never dies, that the soul of each individual man is part of the divine power usually termed God. It teaches also that the soul of man will return to this earth in various incarnations, which represent the different stages of advance toward that perfection of being which is the true goal. Mr. Dulin said that the practice of yoga is materially aided by a vegetarian diet.

            MYSTERIOUS YOGA FAITH OF EAST INDIA WHICH HAS ROBBED AN AMERICAN CITIZEN OF A DEVOTED WIFE A Weird Religion. It is a weird religion, that of the Yogi, known in its generic form, but, in its many mysterious ramifications, regarded in awesome ignorance. That these fakirs do perform some wonders that not seem altogether inexplicable less, is attested by numerous reputable witnesses. But the power behind all this is still a mystery, clothed in the limitless shroud of occultism that only the East Indian can employ. To the Caucasian, the self-abnegation required to arrive at the perfect point that the Yogi assumes seems an impossibility of attainment. The marvelous concentration of will, it is said, makes the human brain capable of accomplishments. Yet the Yogi claims that they have gained mastery over this indomitable will forever, and, in this mastery, lies the power which enables them to govern natural laws, even to the 
            intangible law of gravitation. This power, which is in constant play, gives them control over the force of creation, the beginning of all being, and indeed, is a part of this faith. They believe that when man has gained his first purified form, and cast aside all grossness, he will return again to his original state. Belief of the Yogi The circle of existence runs unending and upon it rests the truth of all material and spiritual life. It is believed, therefore, that when their self-imposed trials of abnegation are performed stoically, they have gained their end, and are united in all respects to the Supreme Being, whom they worship. The main object of the Yogi is to establish a doctrine of a Supreme Being, and to teach the means by which the human soul may become permanently united with it. This Supreme Being is the reputed founder of the system, defined as a particular spirit who is untouched by affections, works the
            result of whose desires, in whom the germ of omnipotence reaches its supreme limit, and who is the preceptor of even the first because he is not limited by time. His appellation is Om. To attain the consciousness which leads to union of the soul with the Supreme Being, eight stages are taught. These are: moral and religious rectification, posture regulation of the breath, restraint, fixation, and profound contemplation. Self-Control and Religion. The first stage, self-control, consists in not doing injury to living beings, veracity, avoidance of theft, chastity, and non-acceptance of gifts. The second stage, religious observance, comprises external, as well as internal purity, contentment, austerity, muttering of the Vedic hymns, and devoted reliance on the Supreme Being. The third stage of Yoga, postures of various sorts, is regarded as essential to those following. The fourth stage, regulation of the breath, is three-fold,
            according as it concerns exhalation and inhalation, or becomes tantamount to the suspension of the breath. The fifth stage, the strength of the senses, means the diversion or withdrawal of the senses from their respective objects, and their entire accommodation to the nature of the mind. This stage is preparatory to the sixth, or the steadying of the mind, which means the freeing of the mind from any sensual disturbance by fixing the thoughts upon some part of the body, usually the tip of the nose. Meditation and Contemplation. Meditation, the seventh stage, is the fixing of the mind on the one object of knowledge, the Supreme Being, to the exclusion of all other thoughts. The eighth, or last stage, profound contemplation, is the perfect absorption of thought into the object, the Supreme Being; it is devoid of all thoughts and meditations. In such a state, a Yogi is insensible to heat and cold, to pleasure and pain; he has
            the same prosperity and adversity; he amends in ascetic reduction. The last three stages are generalized again, because upon their perfection depend the wonderful results which are promised to those who apply them to the extreme. Such results are, for example, the knowledge of the past and future, the knowledge of the sounds of all creatures, the knowledge of what has happened in one's former births, of the thoughts of others, and the length of the human frame; the power of levitation, the overcoming of hunger and thirst, death at will, and the creation of all that exists in the different worlds; and an analysis of the structure of one's own body. Their Eight Great Powers. There are eight great powers which a Yogi will accomplish when properly regulating his knowledge—the power of shrinking into the form of the minutest atom, of becoming extremely light, of becoming extremely heavy, of unlimited reach of the organs, of 
            irresistible will, of obtaining perfect dominion over everything, of changing the course of nature, and, lastly, of going anywhere at will. If the Yogi apply his knowledge to the contemplation of the smallest division of time and the successive order in which such divisions occur, he makes a discrimination which enables him to understand the subtle elements and to pass into the infinite. When his intellect has become free from passion he knows neither friend nor enemy, and no longer is subject to the result of acts performed, and when both have thus obtained the same degree of purity, the Yogi obtains eternal liberation. This is the religion that Mrs. Stead has adopted. But enough of technicalities. In practical demonstrations the Yogis have made their faith stand the world’s amazement. And their demonstrations are of remarkable puzzles and marvels. The existence of God, as realized by them, is a matter of absolute 
            demonstration—the forbidden fruit of the perfect man, and an element of life itself, as is oft witnessed frequently by foreigners. Yogi named Govinda-Swami, on the terrace of his own house. Being by no means credulous, Jacolliot took every precaution to prevent deception. Fine sand was strewn on the ground in order to make as even a surface as possible. The justice was asked to seat himself at a table, upon which was a pencil and paper. The fakir carefully laid a piece of wood upon the sand, and announced that whatever figures Jacolliot might draw on the paper would be transcribed precisely upon the sand by the piece of wood. The Yogi stretched out his hand, and the wooden piece immediately copied upon the sand the most complicated and twisted figures that Jacolliot drew. When the Frenchman stopped writing, the piece of wood also came to a standstill. Read Words in His Mind. The fakir stood at a distance against a 
            wall, while the justice held the paper and pencil in such a way that the Indian could not possibly see what he was writing. Finally, the Indian asked Jacolliot to think of some words in Sanskrit, whereupon the piece of wood instantly traced n the sand the very words that were in the justice's mind. The fakir next stretched out his hand toward a huge bronze vase, filled with water, and weighing several hundred pounds. In five minutes the vase began to move, approaching the fakir with a slow, regular motion. When the distance between the vase and the paper had been considerably diminished, the vase began to emit loud, metallic sounds, as if struck with an iron rod. Occasionally, the noise would resemble the roar of a fire. At Jacolliot's request, the fakir made the vase stop, move, and stop again. Then, Jacolliot demanded that the metal tones should sound again at the end of ten seconds, and the phenomenon was repeated 
            at the exact moment, which he noted by his own watch. He asked that the sounds should keep time to the tune of a music box, which he wound up for the purpose. This requirement, too, was fulfilled. Buried For Three Months. Other demonstrations of the Yoga, even more startling and seemingly more impossible, have been recorded. Sir Claude Wade, in company with several English army officers, witnessed a demonstration at Lahore, India, that even more fully demonstrated the power of the fakir to suspend life in his own body. This fakir was buried quite naturally in a grave dug for the purpose, and the earth was piled in upon him. Sir Claude took every precaution against the body being disturbed, keeping a guard about the grave constantly. At the expiration of three months, the time specified for the end of the demonstration, he superintended the disinterment of the man, who, when the earth had been removed, walked from the 
            grave alive and well. During the interim, he had been hermetically sealed, and had had nothing to eat or drink, thus proving beyond the question of a doubt, his ability to suspend breathing and animation at will. Other Demonstrations. Other familiar demonstrations of the Yogi are the throwing of a rope into the air, the demonstrator climbing up to an invisible height, finally vanishing completely; the appearance and disappearance of the operator at will before his audience; the ability to withstand the application of hot irons and sword thrusts with seeming indifference, and the control that enables him to pose for hours at a time in an apparently cramped condition without the movement of a muscle.

            The larger part of the mental energy of the majority of people in this country is needlessly wasted by the constant rush of their daily lives, which is merely the result of a lack of self-control. The secret revealed by Karma Yoga teaches how to avoid this waste and also the nervous disorders which are the outcome. ""Then comes Bhakti Yoga. I find not only your women but also the men, the business and professional men, much in need of this teaching. It is for those of an emotional nature. It is the path of devotion and love. It teaches how to fulfill the purpose of life both here and in the hereafter. ""The third is Raja Yoga, the path of concentration and meditation. This field covers the whole psychic plane and describes the processes by which the psychic powers are developed, such as thought reading, clairvoyance, clairaudience, the evolving of finer perceptions, the going out of the body, the curing of disease 
            through mental power. Everything taught in such kindred treatments as mental healing, Christian Science, the Emmanuel movement has been taught as one element of a great whole for generation after generation by the believers and followers of the Vedanta. ""Displayed by Jesus of Nazareth and which are used today by the so-called new sects have been an open book for years to the Yogis or wise men of India. Christian Science, the new Emmanuel, can give us nothing new. But we do not overemphasize peculiar cult; we do not believe in the constant obsession of the mind by the thought of disease, even though the healing of the disease is the ultimate reason for that obsession. ""It is in Raja Yoga that the wonderful system of breathing is taught, whose effects are not unknown to the mental healers of the West, but it does not cease to warn its students that the attainment of any of these powers is not a sign of spirituality.
            ""Jnana Yoga is the fourth method. It is the path of right knowledge and discrimination. It is for those who are of a philosophic nature. It explains the fundamental principles of spiritualism, tells us how the soul exists after death and under what conditions, describes how the earthbound are reincarnated, taking human form again and again. It expounded the law of correspondences ages before Swedenborg was born."" The only other resident swami at the Vedanta society at present besides Swami Paramananda is Swami Abhedananda, who delivers a special course of lectures during the winter and holds the Yoga classes for members only.

             A PAGE HOW YOUNG GIRLS STUDY THE FOR HINDOO METHOD OF REST AND RELAXATION THAT there is a great deal of good in the old Hindu philosophy of rest and relaxation is a truth that has again been demonstrated by recent happenings. One of these is the fact that many young girls, girls as young as 10 or 12 years of age, find it necessary to rest from school work or mental and physical exertion of any kind, temporarily, and take a rest cure, just as the jaded society woman withdraws from her social activities to recuperate, and during the retirement they are taught the value of absolute relaxation. The other is that, simultaneously with the scientific study of rest and relaxation by the young girl of today, the Yogi treatment and philosophy are brought into prominence by the leaders in the Emmanuel movement who rely upon this old Hindu method for restoring the mind and body to a natural and healthful condition. Yogi breathing,
            Yogi physical exercises and Yogi philosophy of relaxation are made a feature of the practical side of the Emmanuel treatment of certain cases, and this form of treatment is proved to be so beneficial in restoring wasted mental and physical force that the method is now being applied to young persons, the idea being that the sooner a girl learns how to rest and relax scientifically the stronger will be her vitality and the better will be her ability to withstand the strain that modern life puts upon the individual. It is not because girls are breaking down earlier or are showing a loss of nervous force at a younger age than formerly that they are being taught how to take care of themselves after the oriental fashion, but because parents and guardians see that it is important to them to learn as early as possible the value of this quaint and simple philosophy which has been practiced centuries upon centuries and has brought
            about excellent results. The difficulty experienced by a grown person in learning to relax properly and to rest perfectly is multiplied by that person's years. It follows quite naturally, then, that the earlier one begins studying this science the easier it comes to one and the greater are its advantages all during life. Besides the beneficial effects derived from the practice of Hindu philosophy and physical exercises the idea of the science can not fail to appeal to the young girl. The principle of the treatment is simple to understand and the rules are easy to follow, while the results are almost always immediate enough to be encouraging and to stimulate interest in the cult. One of the hardest things to do is to relax completely. Some persons think they are letting go of their muscles, but in reality they are not. Instead, the grip of their muscles is tense and it is almost impossible for them to relax even after a 
            series of mental and physical treatment. Relaxing is partly mental, so that youthful minds are easier to grasp this idea than grown persons. AMONG the best relaxing exercises are those which start with the body standing and letting go of each muscle and joint separately. First the arms are outstretched in front and the fingers are permitted to drop, to fall of themselves, and when they are perfectly limp and inactive then the relaxing should be continued to the forearm, then to the upper arm, letting the whole arm drop loosely at the side and not only remain motionless but possess the sensation of utter relaxation. These exercises in letting go of the tension of the muscles should be continued to the feet, then the legs, the pupil lifting and dropping each one in turn; then to the shoulders and the head by letting the latter fall loosely as it will either in front or to one side and the whole pupil relax the body ""slumping""
            forward. Even the waist and the hips can be relaxed, although the loosening of the tension will be less noticeable. Now, after the various muscles have been taught what perfect relaxation means and this is only the beginning of the treatment—lie down on a couch or a bed that is not too soft and let go of the entire body, supplementing the physical relaxation with a mental attention to these muscles and members of the body. The Hindu maintains that the mind must be fixed on the muscle relaxation in order to get the best results and to make the ""letting go"" thorough and complete, especially when one is learning the first principles of relaxing. Resting like this once or twice during the day will restore one quickly to normal condition, and a few minutes devoted to perfect relaxation are worth an hour or more of sleep of the ordinary kind. It sounds more or less absurd to one who does not understand the art and science of 
            relaxation and perfect rest to say that one's energy and vitality can be restored without having the pupil lie down. The method to pursue in this quick restoration process is to think of oneself in their active position; that is, with the head up, shoulders back and chest expanded slightly. The arms should be allowed to drop loosely at the sides. While in this position the body on the balls of the feet, lifting the heels gradually and throwing them back to the floor. the weight forward, with the body still held erect and not tilted forward. As the heels rise the arms should be lifted straight out at the sides and upward until they pass above the horizontal line. Breathe deeply as the arms ascend, then hold the position for a minute or so and gradually let the heels drop down and the arms fall limply at the sides, not forgetting to exhale slowly and evenly as the original position is resumed. PROPER breathing has quite as
             much to do with the success of the relaxing and the muscle exercises as the movements themselves. One can fall into what approaches a mesmerized state just by breathing in the oriental fashion and continuing the action for a few minutes. While lying flat on your back raise the right hand to the nostrils, and with the finger or the thumb close one side tightly, making it necessary to breathe through the other. Rhythmical breathing is essential to perfect repose. With the hand at the nostrils alternate by inhaling through the right side and exhaling through the left, then reversing the order by closing the other side. Instead of expanding the chest first as you breathe try abdominal breathing for the rest cure by continuing the reclining position and alternating the nostrils as inhalers and exhalers. Then begin by taking a deep breath from deep down in the abdominal region, gradually inflating the other parts of the chest
            and lungs as the breathing is continued on up to the very tops of the lungs. In this way the abdomen, chest, and even the upper section of the lungs or the collarbone are raised and expanded with the air. Hold it a few seconds, then exhale by first drawing in the abdomen, then dropping the lower part of the chest and finally allowing the upper part to fall as much as possible breathing is essential to perfect repose. With the hand at the nostrils alternate by inhaling through the right side and exhaling through the left, then reversing the order by closing the other side. Instead of expanding the chest first as you breathe, try abdominal breathing for the rest cure by continuing the reclining position and alternating the nostrils as inhalers and exhalers. Then begin by taking a deep breath from deep down in the abdominal region, gradually inflating the other parts of the chest and lungs as the breathing is continued on up 
            to the very tops of the lungs. In this way the abdomen, chest, and even the upper section of the lungs or the collarbone are raised and expanded with the air. Hold it a few seconds, then exhale by first drawing in the standing position, with the feet spread a little apart, heels almost touching, head up, shoulders back, chest expanded and the abdomen drawn in. This is the way to start. Then, if you want to begin with an easy exercise, stretch the arms forward in front, keeping them level with the shoulders, and with the palms of the hands pressed together gently, not rigidly, swing the arms back, keeping them on the same horizontal plane until they are as far back of the shoulders as they will go. At first you will not be able to touch the backs of the hands, but after a little practice this will come quite readily. Do this quickly backward and forward for 10 times and then see how much better the muscles of the back feel 
            and how much easier it is to stand erect.

            POsition Is Everything in Life to Yogi Practitioners By B.K. Tiwari. NEW DELHI (UPI)—Ancient Hindu saints, it is believed here, lived as long as 2000 years. They then went to heaven, traveled through hell, explored space and returned to earth to tell their people all about those regions. Their secret was ""Yoga""—the Indian way of controlling mind and body.Rishis (saints) Brataharti, Markandeya, the Saptarishi brothers and Narad are some notable legendary figures who lived a world life for as much as 2000 years and then left for a heavenly abode at their will. ""Yoga"" is a comprehensive term which embodies a number of postures called ""asans."" These ""asans"" are dependent upon the physiology of the body and its muscular and nervous systems. The ""Yoga"" system has three divisions, Karma Yoga, Hatha Yoga and Gyan Yoga. Karma Yoga is practiced to achieve peace of mind while living in this world. Its best exposition is found in the Gita,
            the Hindus' holy bible. Hatha Yoga has preventive as well as curative qualities for all ailments, Hindus believe. Perfection in this Yoga system would make a man capable of living in any climatic conditions without any difficulty. Deep breathing and meditation are the essence of Yoga. Prime Minister Nehru and his daughter Indira practice part of Hatha Yoga. Nehru now no longer stands on his head. But he does deep breathing almost every day. Hatha Yoga is regarded as a prime Yoga effort which gradually comes to be the methodical approach to the attainment of the highest in the Yoga. Hatha Yoga accepts man for what he really is. It therefore does not neglect the physical aspect of a person's life. Yoga experts recommend Hatha Yoga for space flights among other things. Gyan Yoga is the highest form of Yoga. By achieving perfection in this branch, according to Hindus, a person can leave his body at will, travel as far as he likes and then re-enter his body.

            ¿Qué Es El Yoga? Yoga es una palabra sánscrita que significa literalmente unión, aunque también tiene las acepciones de “contemplación” y “concentración”. Por yoga se comprende el método que ha de seguir el hombre para llegar a la mística unión con Dios. Los indúistas reconocen varias clases de yoga: los yoga de sabiduría, donde se logra la liberación por medio de la comprensión, conocimientos y sabiduría adquiridos por el ejercicio de la razón pura. La Yoga-Raja, o yoga mental que consiste en el dominio de la mente y del cuerpo mediante la actuación de la voluntad, de acuerdo con ciertos métodos, como el de la respiración rítmica. La Yoga-Karma, o yoga de acción que consiste en la realización de buenas obras. La Yoga-Bhakti o devocional que consiste en el sincero anhelo de la unión amorosa con el infinito, es una yoga mística donde se pide a Dios amor y devoción pero se abstienen de pedir favores y merecedes personales como hacemos nosotros con nuestros santos. 
            Hay además el Hatha-yoga, que es muy susceptible de perversión pues suele conducir a la magia negra a los espíritus pusilánimes.

            Con la Práctica del Yoga se Puede Vivir Muchos Años Más El Karma Yoga, el Hatha Yoga y el Gyan Yoga — Peligroso si se Experimenta Equivocadamente Los antiguos santos hindúes vivían hasta 2,000 años. Estaban en el cielo, recorrían los infiernos, rondaban por el espacio y regresaban a la tierra para contarle todo a la gente. Su secreto era el Yoga, la manera india de controlar la mente y el cuerpo. Los Rishis (santos) Bratahari, Markandeya Saptarishi y Narad son algunas de las figuras legendarias que vivieron una vida terrestre durante 2,000 años y luego la dejaron, por la celestia, por su propia voluntad. ""Yoga"" es un término amplio que comprende una cantidad de posturas llamadas “Asans.” Estas “Asans” dependen de la fisiología del cuerpo y su sistema muscular y nervioso. El sistema ""Yoga"" tiene tres divisiones, el Karma Yoga, el Hatha Yoga y el Gyan Yoga. El Karma Yoga se practica para lograr la paz de la mente en este mundo. Su mejor exposición se encuentra en el Gita, la biblia de los hindúes. El Hatha Yoga tiene cualidades curativas,
            así como preventivas, para todos los males. La perfección en este sistema yoga, haría a un hombre capaz de vivir en cualquier condición climática sin dificultad alguna. La respiración profunda y la meditación constituyen la esencia del yoga. El Primer Ministro de India, Jawaharlal Nehru, y su hija, Indira, practican parte del Hatha Yoga. Nehru no se pone cabeza abajo, pero hace aspiraciones profundas todos los días. Se considera el Hatha Yoga como un esfuerzo primario que, gradualmente, llega a reconocerse en el acercamiento a la perfección de la mente

            Love Tangles Too, Too Solid Even for Yoga Mrs. Florence Street could not get her husband, Robert A. Street, wealthy radio executive, to take his meals regularly. Then, as if that were not enough, Mrs. Edith Street lived in despair because she could not account for a series of strange happenings. At least, according to Mrs. Street, when Robert Street got a notion to judge her mental equilibrium, he did it in a way that seemed to defy all reason. “Yoga,” he explained, is that mystic philosophy of the East, whose exponents rise to triumph in all kinds of weird feats, such as attitude making themselves invisible. Yogis, as the practitioners of Yoga are called, eat carrots, stand on their heads and squat. Learning that Robert had acquired his taste for these activities at the exquisite feet of Miss Barnes, his wife went into a New York court and charged as much. She said he’d told her that Yogi High Priestess Carman had given him “new life, new love, new hope and a complete new cycle”—by which he did not mean a bicycle. He meant a life cycle, 
            which is something you have over and over again, like the common cold. Her testimony won Mrs. Street a new separation and new alimony. Robert, meanwhile, had skipped out to Reno and won himself a full-dress divorce. At least, it was full-dress everywhere but in New York. There, the courts considered his wife’s suit the more formal, so his was fruitless. Mr. Street was dissatisfied, as a consequence, and it seems a fair surmise that Mrs. Street was a little dissatisfied, too. Whether or not she then proceeded to work off her Yoga-bred dissatisfaction by getting another woman's husband to do things he hadn’t done before is a question which Mrs. Edith Marko now has asked the New York courts to pass upon. If the answer is “Yes,” as Mrs. Marko believes, then she will win a separation from her Robert, plus $500 a week alimony and $5,000 for her lawyers. Mrs. Marko's description of Mrs. Street is scarcely that of a wife unable to hold a husband. She calls her, ""A Jezebel, a Lorelei, full of guile, who sings songs of love, making foolish men mad with desire.""
            Curiously enough, the incident which allegedly showed Mrs. Street in her new colors was precipitated not by Mrs. Marko but by Mr. Street, who all this time has been biding his time, dissatisfied. The detectives, who raided her Bucks County, Pa., retreat a while ago, were his detectives. And, as they walked into the house, they testified, down the stairs came the lady of the house and Mrs. Marko’s Robert, convivially wearing bathrobes. Mrs. Street and Mr. Marko, for their part, assert that they weren’t there to play, but to write a play. After kindly turning over his alleged findings to Mrs. Marko, so she could start suing, Mr. Street started suing again himself, in the New York courts this time. He asked for a divorce, and if not that an annulment, and if not THAT at least a separation.
